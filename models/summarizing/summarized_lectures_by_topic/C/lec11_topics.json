    "Topic 1": " We're going to look at some particular characteristics or properties of English syntax . We're also gonna look at a formal system for describing structure called context-free grammars . We can think about and analyze the internal parts of sentences and find patterns that we can better explain through positing hierarchical structures . And I'll go through a bunch of tests to check whether something a group of words is a constituent or not .  A formal understanding helps us to develop appropriate algorithms for handling and dealing with hierarchical structures and syntax plus? Fsa's our finance data are particular ways to talk about and describe regular grammar . It's more natural and useful to use a more powerful class of formal grammars . These are in particular context, free grammar, that's what we're gonna talk about .  Grammars are just a different view of the hierarchical structure of language . Usually it means that you have to split up a category into multiple categories . A noun can be 1st or second or 3rd person. nouns . And that's really cool because it's a computational model . And it turns out you can do things the other way around, too .",
    "Topic 2": " There are some strings that are accepted by the language, say English, and they're part of the set of valid English sentences . But there are other strings which are not accepted and they don't form valid sentences . Different formalisms and different languages might have different syntac categories that seem to make sense for them .  In computational linguistics, we're trying to describe possible sentences that could be accepted . We're not just linguists but computational linguists . We assume that our goal is to characterize exactly the set of strings that form valid sentences of English . We need to come with subcategories of the verbs, depending on what constraints they add to the other elements in the sentence .  In practice you have to limit yourself to . At most, I will have, this, many empty elements in a row, or something that. In fact, this is just a shorthand. This is 6 different rules. It's these are, think of these as 6 different . rules. We'll have B 2 with an S. And v, 2 without an XS. and v. 3 with an s. and then v 3 without an s .",
    "Topic 3": " A common misconception is that things that are non standard or informal or casual somehow have no grammar . It's quite possible that the informal version of a language has a different grammar compared to the formal version, the written version and the prestigious version . You can say I saw Jean-claude Van Dam. this is also a noun phrase, the word the single word . You cannot just say I . saw a van from Jean. You can . say I was beaten up by Jean-Claude, madame, the muscles from Brussels who beat me up . But the type of constituent stays the same .  In natural language there seems to be no fixed upper bound in terms of the length of a sentence . The grammar is made up of a noun phrase plus a verb phrase . The Vp is the subject, it can be any noun phrase, and then it gives you . But the really interesting thing here is that you can have it .  You can directly tell here that there's a subject relation with this arc. To the left of some Vp or something, and that's quite complex . Also, you can convert between them. You can merge it with 4.4 that causes this whole thing to be a prepositional phrase . And finally, you have studied, which takes in 2 arguments with students and for the exam .",
    "Topic 4": " The reading assignments are not meant to take a long time there, but they are there, those to help complement the material that we discuss in the course . If you need any help in finding final project members, if you haven't started thinking about that yet we will provide help for that as .  In this context language simply refers to the set of strings that you want to accept . We're going to take machinery and theory and apply it to natural language . In natural language you can talk about. Can we write to a word this? Can you write to kicks? Can we . write to jumps and over? You start off with a starting symbol .  English has a very limited amount of subject-verb agreements in the present tense, . The only thing we really have to fix is, we need to ensure that if you have a singular 3rd person. , let's fix that part of the grammar. We want to have rules that check and ensure for correspondences between the features and different parts of your sentence. through a feature-based account of a language .",
    "Topic 5": " We're going to talk about how structures in a sentence can be formed and assembled to create larger units, larger structures . Then we'll get to that after the art and syntax . We'll talk about syntax and semantics. We're only going to be concerned with descriptive grammars .  A formal grammar is a set of rules and other associated things that help you generate a language . It turns out for the syntax of natural languages, where multiple constituents and some categorizations and other phenomena . But I'll just replace the part to do with verbs for the verbs you want to account for . And that's how you create a grammar that respects the subcategorization of these verbs .  In a dependency grammar, you draw arrows directed directed directed edges to connect and describe this relation . The advantage of talking about dependency as opposed to constituents is that it exposes the syntactic relations, the grammatical relations much more easily, whereas in the dependency grammar it's much more clearly exposed ."

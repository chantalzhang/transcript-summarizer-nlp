    "Topic 1": " We will review the Lccrf and also the most performance Rnn architecture . Then we discuss a support vector machine . And also we discussed artificial, neural, network, artificial neural network . The idea of recurring run network is that you have different states. And that you want to be able to compute all the States .  Shidan Javaheri: I feel you would capture the context of the entire thing that's being said, and then give the output in a response . This by Lstm, to have a portrayed language model. We can also fine tune Elmo, for your downstream tasks just the way you fine tune events model for a downstream task .",
    "Topic 2": " The deadline is Friday this Friday, October 11th . If you have questions on the reading assignments, please post on it. I will try to answer. I've posted the corrected version on Ed. Ed. If you can on your camera, we can. Then it's easier for me to get some feedback if I have .  We always need nonlinearity because we are moving. We can have problems in your recurring neural networks what is called exploding gradients and then vanishing gradients . Lstm can be used for all tasks from pathosp, tagging to nameless recognition . David Ifeoluwa Adelani: for machine translation, you need to encode all the sentence information for language .",
    "Topic 3": " Long, short term memory networks, which is the most popular and the most used for part of speed tagging . You can also, define features for other tasks any other tasks . And we also showed how you can find the close form. , if we are interested in the previous tag of P, part of speech to determine what will be the current act .  Shidan Javaheri: I think the 1st one would be best for machine translation . David Ifeoluwa Adelani: But but but but , this one is better for machine . It would be better for part of speak tagging for the Lstm architecture or Nlp .  You want to predict x 4 x 5 x 6. And you want to . predict x . 4 x 6 . Shidan Javaheri: I had imagined that would also be helpful for large from language modeling . David Ifeoluwa Adelani: Your role is in time, you are predicting the word also alongside .",
    "Topic 4": " Recurrence neural networks is the learning model which automatically learns nonlinear functions from impute to output, neural networks can learn it . If you have enough data with neural networks, it's really an interesting architecture or method . Vivek Verma: Is it because the document text has , the input, is many words. If you want to do document classification, we just need a classification. If it's near 0, you will likely forget that information .  The idea of bi-directional Lstm is very, very simple in your standard neural network . Instead of just using a simple fifall neural network at the hand, you need to pass it to a last feed forward neural network to make the final prediction . It's a good model for it .",
    "Topic 5": " We skipped the lecture on Wednesday because of the Nrp. that will be offered by one of the tutors. I also hope you learned something that is useful for the research and for deepening your understanding on Nop, and they discuss very trendy topics that you can focus on for research .  Lstm scores with those of the transition probabilities . Vision Committee were curious if they can use the same architecture also for vision tasks . Of course we'll be looking at the article structure of a language which will be taught by. The one in the chat is asking, will we talk about Bert or transformers?"

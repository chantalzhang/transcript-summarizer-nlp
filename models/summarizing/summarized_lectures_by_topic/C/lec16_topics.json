    "Topic 1": " We're in the setting of syntax-driven semantic composition . When you do a syntactic composition by applying a rule in your context-free grammar . And semantically, you're also combining things to build a bigger meaning chunk of meaning representation . And in our case it's 1st order logic. And here's the syntax driven semantic composition a rule that we have?  Students don't really do reasoning and logic and they often don't do when it comes to thinking about how many entities and how many things there are in a particular context, because they don't build these logical representations . You can also imagine defining a new constant for King of France, just for proper nouns . With the rules we described, you will get only the 1st reading .",
    "Topic 2": " Each word at the leaf of the tree is associated with some fragment of meaning representation in the logic that we care about . And then something called definite descriptions . that's why we do this complex thing of of this is called reification, ? But the concept is the same. First, st we have to have a semantic attachment to the lexical rule. And the way you derive this particular form is just. Because for the direct object, you have something Vp rewrites to Vnp Rule is still there, and it's still the same .  This is an illustration of this general idea, which is that we need a representation that is under specified with respect to some properties that we cannot no, until we have more contacts or more information . In Cooper Storage, the general idea is that everything that you don't know yet you store it away .",
    "Topic 3": " The syntax part is you combine things to make a bigger syntactic chunk . You also do function application in Lambdas to build up a bigger piece of the meaning representation for the whole constituents . There's a whole series of reasoning steps you can derive to show that this is the way that you need to make to make all the representations look similar to each other in form .  In Bertrand Russell, Bertone Russell asserts that there is an entity who is the student . There's an entity that's a student. There's a set of things in the world that are smart . And a smart student is at the intersection of both smart and fake students .  S. 1 is associated with for all students, because it's the students who are taking the courses . There exists a Y course Y, and that's associated with S. 2 with the second entry in your storage . When you have extra information, you can take things out of storage, and then recombine recombine them with the meaning representations to get the correct sentence level representation .",
    "Topic 4": " A common thing people do is that they reify it. This abstract idea that it's a it's an entity. and you can talk about when it happened, and or will it happen? But the high level concept is exactly the same. We've done intransitive verbs and transitive verbs. We're gonna skip to the lexical rules and then come back to talk about definiteness .  Bertrand Russell said there exists an X such that p of x, and . There exists a unique thing that has that predicate must be that thing . And if it's unique, that means everything else that has a predicate is that thing. And the queue themselves would introduce those other things. They both will be stuffed into the queue itself, and they'll be introduced by the other parts of the queue. And then you can, you can do this for the rest of the sentence and work through all of those function applications very carefully .  We want an underspecified representation that is compatible with both readings . After you've read the whole syllabus, and then you can go back to retrieve and derive the corrects disambiguated meaning representation . The under specified representation for every student took a course with these rules, and with the this rule for the transitive verb .",
    "Topic 5": " We're gonna look at how in logic you have these universal and existential quantifiers, and how we can use them to model quantifiers and natural language . When you do more syntactic composition, then you combine more pieces of meaning representation together, and then Lambdas will help you figure out exactly how you should combine the meaning representation .  Pnq, the A is the existential outscoping the universal . course still looks what it does from before a still looks like it did from before . We're gonna say that s 1 and S 2 are, gonna be these special here. But we won't capture every possible explicit sentence. And then you do beta reduction. Then what you do is you retrieve thing from you, retrieve things from storage ."

    "Topic 1": " It does not distinguish between mother and father. moda or father, or in rather mother or father in Chinese. Some languages does not have plural and some languages they don't have plural . Some words such as again stop, or more if you have the word mark called again. If you speak Chinese, you can relate to this and then also some languages .  Details of a model that I'm trying to split at the moment, which is just the formulation. the length has to be the same. And here we can use compute this using Emily. and the idea of using Md. using the number I made. and after that you can multiply it. And after that we're going to examine the last model which would be neural based .",
    "Topic 2": " David Ifeoluwa Adelani: It's just very good at the general machine translation domain but there are some specific domains that even if you try it the current models may still fail . The current models fail for low resource languages, it will still fail for some domains, , medical domain finance domain, and very, very specific domains . The Interlingua is a conceptual space common to all languages, that if you can take the source text to this intelliga .  You have to think about things possibility of translation . Many, too many mapping is impossible to do the mapping directly . You can try to use tabs to send sentence lines longest common subsequence of characters . And then, the because morphologically, return is, they just keep attaching, prefix, depending on what has been added .",
    "Topic 3": " When do we expect that we'll get the grades back? It used to be a very, very difficult problem. but I'm not sure it's very difficult. even the current models doesn't solve the task. It's just that languages with different syntatic structure, with different morphology and with different semantics, and on. .  The idea of linguistic Olympia, this is very simple. They can give you a language or 2 languages . And then they give you rules of the language, and they ask you to perform a task in a language given some rules . Decode is what we change from, understand to understood this. Ibm developed a series of 5 differential models .",
    "Topic 4": " Different languages require or allow different morphological, synthetic, somatic discourse properties . The language you speak affects your thoughts. Different languages use different structures. Legal documents are different in different countries. There is a marketing translation tax that is called formality, where you could give a text in English and then give it a . formality. Different levels of requirements of for inflection. In Zulu you can also have suffix in Zulu .  When we have a sentence, there are different ways to do the alignments, . You have different ways of doing this . The length of the sentence is also one of the things we should consider based on what we talked about . The probability of a given E is mostly concerned about the translation lines at the moment .",
    "Topic 5": " We'll be talking about machine translation machine translation . We'll start thinking about the problem by discussing the noisy training model for empty on the Ibm model . Then can you create a statistical model for machine translation? This is a theory that has not been implemented implemented . And if you have a multi-language machine translation model, you can train an estimator model .  There are a lot of tricks you can use. the dynamic time working, which is for any distance. and then factors to consider for the word alignment . Another thing that is very important, especially if you move to different languages is the word order . And then, after you have known the alignment, you just produce the indices. And you saw the task. That's seems to be correct. And and and I, , that's looks correct should be correct ."

    "Topic 1": " The language model is a very, very simple concept that has been a statistical Nlp for many, many years and we even have statistical language models before neural language models where you can pick a small chunk of text . And the key insight is that you learn correlations between words for many page generation capacity .  The same sentence to have multiple interpretations and be ambiguous . Individual words themselves can also have multiple meanings, multiple interpretations . The high level of the course will be that there will be some correspondence between the Nlp topic with the linguistic layer, with some of the techniques we'll have semantics and reference resolution, which is at the meeting level .",
    "Topic 2": " The goal of Cl is language technology applications and also scientifically understanding how language works . We want to say, this course, is focus on natural language, but we also have other forms of languages programming languages . This is not about large language models, but this is not a focus of the cost languages everywhere . There's issues to do with articulation and transmission and perception .  Comp. 5, 50 is to help students understand the broad topics and applications and common terminology of the field . It will help prepare you for either research or employment, including internships in computational linguistics or Nlp . We'll talk about using logic to represent the meaning of sentences and how they affect the meanings of words .",
    "Topic 3": " Professor Jackie Cheung, Professor: It's the same. there's a way to keep them, but not show them on screen . We're going to talk all about what this course is about the topics and forth. We're in Quebec, you could use English or French to write your essay are susceptible. But please do acknowledge it if you use this technology .  English has a very simple, relatively simple system of word formation . We do a lot of work on problem specification, on thinking about machine learning algorithms, on eliciting annotations from humans, especially when we have a particular representation that we want to parse it to, . We can talk about pros and cons at that point as . or with, say, neural networks .",
    "Topic 4": " An associate professor in the School of computer science and I'm also affiliated with Mila. I work on topics around multilingual Nlp machine translation, representation Lane. Lane. I'll take few slides before adding over to Jackie. I'm if I didn't pronounce it. I've gotten our lstn very difficult.  In this course, we're going to cover many of these different areas, 2 different levels of depth . In modern Nlp, often we often think about machine learning as some combination of some pre specified knowledge, and also machine learning methods, but still some machine learning based or learning methods . And what form the data should have to have as the form of this data as the algorithms and models that construct and train on this data .  We'll start with text classification where we mostly are concerned at the granularity of individual words . And then the linguistic layer is also words, but potentially also syntactic structures . Then we'll talk about machine translation, summarization and potentially other applications potentially other issues with evaluation and ethics of Nlp .",
    "Topic 5": " By the end of today's lectures, at least, you should be able to know what these terms mean, semantics and pragmatics . We're using zoom today as a backup lecture recording, although it's supposed to be automatically done . The largest proportion of the languages in the world are in Asia, followed by Africa, and then the Pacific or that scales to other languages .  This discourse is the study of the structure of larger spans of language beyond individual clauses or sentences . In English, we have strict rules about the orderings of words, and how you're allowed to put them together to form a sentence . In other languages, Finnish or Czech or Swahili, many other languages have very complex morphologies ."

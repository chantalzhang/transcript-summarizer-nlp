    "Topic 1": " Attention can be seen as a soft version of a retriever system from a memory which is a key . Attention is not an interpretability tool if you just analyze what's going on that's not an interpretationability tool . We still need to fix the encoder part of the translation, the decoder part .  The way this model has been trained is also a language model . Even if this pre trained model has not been trained on a language, there's a way you can just quickly adapt it to a new language . The Roberta model, which never got accepted, just did not use this nest sentence prediction, and they were still able to have similar performance .",
    "Topic 2": " There's nothing technical about prompting, but there's there's some ways you can do prompting that will give you better results . We'll talk about a modification of this, we where an attention is introduced. One word at a time, there are some tricks to improve where you can reverse the order of input sentence .  There's a lot of research focusing on how to improve the efficiency of at the decoding time . We're focusing on the encoder only side which is on the left . You can tell the language model that the sentiment of this will be positive, and then you give it another example . You give it an example, then it has an idea that oh, the movie is great means positive. this movie is just a waste of time. You can do this both for 0 shot and few shots with a few examples, and the model will be able to answer him .",
    "Topic 3": " Using, what is the probability of E multiply by the likelihood probability of F given E, and then we can take the Agmax based on the alignment model . In practice you try to restrict this only to your training data to available training data . Then you decide and then model 5 makes use of dependency structure of alignments that they don't depend on each other .  The language model will be able to solve the task of sentiment classification. if you give it another example. The interesting thing is that almost all Nlp tasks, I would say, oh, I don't see any tasks that cannot be converted. you apply a noise function to your text to mark something out. And it's gonna give you every task. If you have 4 classes. if . you have a topic classification . if you have . a topic . categorize this into business news sports, news. entertainment, news, or political news ? It can generate political or politics. because it's a multilingual model. It's not very good, but if you fine tune it explicitly to do this, it will .",
    "Topic 4": " Today we'll talk about attention mechanism, which will bridge the discussion from Rnn and Lstms to the transformer . When the sentence length are high, there's a need to come up with an algorithm to be able to compute these probabilities more efficiently . We don't have this street assumption that every word has to go to 0, or one word, you can have a word that is attached to another word . And the interesting thing with the attention, architecture is that it has been applied to different modality to vision modality .  We want to learn a distribution over words to decide how important each word is in order to compute the representation of the layer at Layer L . Multiplication based on the attention computation is telling you that thinking is attending to itself, when attending to the same sentence, is the most important .  A machine translation model that was trained on, , one on one language and a lot of data, 6.3 trillion tokens, has, , over 34 billion tokens . And you can cast any task as a text generation task . But one issue is that it's sometimes it's tricky for a classification task . Sometimes it can generate different things .",
    "Topic 5": " We'll be talking about neural machine translations . These are more relevant to our models have been trained than Ibm models . We use the recurring neural network in an encoder, decoder manner . You have the memory for every input that you can have . You use this state and memory information to compute what would be the outputs that will be sent to another state . And then you have this context, vector, Z, and then you pass it to the decoder side .  We're still using transformer architecture since 2017, and the title of the paper, which attention is all you need . It seems to work to. it still has some issues in modeling long context dependencies . T. 5 is quite interesting because they use both the encoder, part of the transformer and the decoder side ."

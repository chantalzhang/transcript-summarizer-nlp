Professor Jackie Cheung's lecture covered lexical semantics, focusing on word sense disambiguation and the importance of context in determining a word's intended meaning. The lecture discussed Wordnet, a database organized by word senses, and synsets, groups of synonyms with a common meaning. The complexity of disambiguating word senses was acknowledged, leading to the concept of all-words word sense disambiguation. The use of algorithms, specifically heuristic algorithms and unsupervised machine learning methods, in problem-solving was discussed. The lecture introduced Lusk's and Yarowski's algorithms, which are used for word sense disambiguation. The lecture also touched on the use of supervised machine learning for word sense disambiguation, but noted that this method requires a lot of work to annotate word sense information and a separate model for each word to be disambiguated. The lecture also discussed the concept of bootstrapping in machine learning and data analysis, Hearst patterns for identifying lexical semantic relationships, and the concept of distributional semantics. The lecture concluded with the introduction of word embeddings and the Word2Vec model, a neural network-based method for predicting words in context.

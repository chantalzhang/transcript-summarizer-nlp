The lecture by Professor Jackie Cheung focused on syntax, constituents, and context-free grammars (CFGs) in natural languages. The professor explained the use of CFGs in modeling languages like English, French, and German, and discussed the limitations of CFGs in modeling certain languages like Swiss German and Bambara due to cross serial dependencies. The lecture also covered the concept of parsing in natural languages, which is more complex than in programming languages. The professor introduced the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm for parsing and explained how it works with CFGs. The lecture also discussed the concept of syntactic ambiguity, where a sentence can have multiple interpretations due to its structure. The professor also touched upon the concept of Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs) and mentioned the limitations of the vanilla PCFG assumption. The lecture concluded with a discussion on the use of subject and object pronouns in English.

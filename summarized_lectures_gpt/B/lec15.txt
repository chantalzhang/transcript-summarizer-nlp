The lecture covered the topic of compositional semantics, which is the study of how the meanings of sentences can be derived from their parts. The lecture began with a recap of lexical semantics and a reminder about the upcoming midterm and assignments. The discussion then moved to distribution semantics, focusing on the term context matrix and the technique of point wise mutual information waiting. The lecture also introduced the concept of singular value decomposition (SVD), a popular technique in natural language processing. The lecture then discussed the Word2Vec model from 2013, which uses two methods: the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) model and the Skip-Gram model. The lecture concluded with the introduction of the final major topic for the midterm, which is compositional semantics. This principle suggests that the meaning of a sentence is not arbitrary, but can be understood by examining the meanings of its subparts. The lecture also touched upon the properties of the meaning representations of a sentence and what makes a good meaning representation. The lecture then moved on to the meanings of sentences, both in relation to each other and to the world. The lecture concludes by suggesting that sentences can also convey information about the world or pose queries about it, such as predicting weather or asking about current conditions. The lecture discusses the concept of compositionality in language, which is the idea that the meaning of a sentence can be derived from the meanings of its parts. The lecture also introduces the idea of co-compositionality, where the meaning of the whole is derived from the parts, but the function used to compose the overall meaning is complex and dependent on the parts themselves. The lecture discusses the concept of color perception, particularly focusing on the color red. The lecture then transitions to discussing Montague's approach to sentence meaning, known as Montegovian semantics. This approach, started in the 1970s, uses logic to model sentence meaning, suggesting that there is no significant theoretical difference between natural languages and artificial languages. Montague believed it was possible to understand the syntax and semantics of both types of languages with a single, mathematically precise theory. This approach assumes that natural language can be as precise as logical languages. The lecture discusses the concept of modeling natural language using logical forms and rules of inference. The advantage of this approach is that it allows for the application of logical inference procedures to natural language, once it's converted into a logical form. This is particularly useful in accessing and manipulating data from various sources, such as weather data, through databases using SQL queries. The lecture also highlights the importance of inference in making explicit what was previously implicit in language. Examples of semantic inference are provided to illustrate this point. The lecture concludes with the introduction of the logic to be used for this process, which is the first order logic or first order predicate calculus. The lecturer encourages questions, acknowledging that the topic may be confusing for some. The lecture is about the components of 1st order logic, which are used to translate natural language. The components include a domain of discourse, which is a set of entities that are of interest. Variables, denoted by lowercase letters, represent potential elements within the domain of discourse. Predicates map elements of the domain of discourse to truth values and can have different valences, meaning they can take different numbers of arguments. Functions map elements to other elements within the discourse. The difference between predicates and functions is what they return: predicates return a truth value (true or false), while functions return other elements of the domain of discourse. A function with a valence of 0 would be a constant. The lecture also mentions logical connectives such as not, and, or, implies, and bi-directional entailment, as well as quantifiers. The lecture discusses the basic elements of 1st order predicate calculus, including existential and universal quantifiers. The speaker explains how to convert sentences into logical formulations. For example, "The capital of Italy is Rome" can be transformed into a logical formulation using functions and predicates. In this case, "capital of" and "Italy" are functions, "equals" is a predicate, and "Rome" is an entity. Another example given is "All wugs are blorks", which can be converted into "For all X, if X is a wug, then X is a blork". Here, "wug" and "blork" are predicates, and "X" is a variable that ranges over all elements of discourse. The lecture emphasizes that "for all X" means checking all elements in a given situation. The lecture discusses logical connectives, which take two arguments and evaluate to true or false based on the truth values of these arguments. A truth table can be drawn to represent this. The speaker emphasizes the need to review logical or Boolean connectives to understand their precise meanings. They also discuss the concept of defining functions or predicates to associate every word in English with a piece of logic. These pieces of logic can then be combined to form the overall meaning of a sentence. The speaker mentions that there is an order to apply these functions or predicates, and

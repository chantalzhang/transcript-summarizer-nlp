The lecture focuses on text classification in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It begins by distinguishing between computational linguistics and NLP, and defining natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation. The lecture then introduces various linguistic terms and concepts such as morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, phonetics, and phonology. 

The main topic discussed is the use of NLP in creating a startup for stock trading decisions, highlighting the risks involved. The process of text classification, which includes tasks like language detection, translation, and authorship attribution, is discussed in detail. The lecture also introduces machine learning, defining it as the use of data and statistical algorithms to learn patterns and apply these to new data for task performance. 

The lecture further discusses supervised and unsupervised learning, part of speech tagging, feature extraction, and common processing in text classification systems. It also covers the concepts of lemmatization, stemming, and N-grams in text classification systems. The lecture concludes by discussing the challenges of handling typos and unknown words in data processing, the importance of model selection, and the concept of trading stocks by building a sentiment analysis system.

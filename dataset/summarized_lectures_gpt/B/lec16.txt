Professor Jackie Cheung's lecture focused on syntax-driven semantic composition, a process where each word or lexical item is associated with a fragment of meaning representation in logic. The lecture covered the application of this concept to proper nouns and intransitive verbs, and the use of function application in lambda calculus to build larger pieces of meaning representation. The professor also discussed the role of lambda calculus in building meaning representations and expressing missing information, and the concept of events in the context of verbs and their role in logical representation. 

The lecture also touched on the semantics of intransitive and transitive verbs, the process of semantic attachment, and the application of lambda calculus in deriving the simplified form of verb phrase semantics. The professor also discussed the concept of quantifiers in language, such as 'all' and 'every', and the use of existential and universal quantifiers in logical expressions. 

The lecture also discussed Bertrand Russell's theory of definite descriptions from 1905, the concept of meaning representation in first-order logic, and the limitations of AI in reasoning and understanding quantifiers. The lecture concluded with a discussion on the process of semantic representation in sentences, the concept of existence and uniqueness in the context of linguistic analysis, and the semantics of adjectives. 

The professor also discussed the concept of 'fake' in the context of a 'fake student' and the complexity of language and linguistics, specifically focusing on the concept of modification and quantifiers in natural language. The lecture concluded with a discussion on the limitations of the current approach in deriving readings from syntax, the concept of underspecified representation in the context of sentence interpretation, and the process of syntax-driven semantic composition.

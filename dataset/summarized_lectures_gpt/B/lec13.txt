The lecture covered a range of topics including lexical semantics, Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (Pcfg), and parsing and syntax. The components of a Pcfg, including non-terminals, rules, terminal symbols, and a starting symbol, were discussed. The professor clarified that non-terminals are transitions between tokens, not tokens themselves. The lecture also discussed the limitations of Pcfgs, including their inability to model the context around rules well and the sparsity of the rules themselves. The lecture then delved into the differences between subject and object noun phrases, and the varying distributions of these in sentences. The lecture also touched on the subcategorization of verbs and the possibility of adding adverbs and prepositional phrases. The lecture also addressed the issue of sparsity in rule-based systems and suggested strengthening assumptions to more reliably estimate parameters. The lecture concluded by discussing the importance of semantics in language technology, the philosophy of language, the concept of lexical semantics, and the two ways to define a word: extensional and intentional definitions. The lecture also discussed the complexity of language, focusing on how a single word can have multiple meanings depending on the context. The lecture concluded with a discussion on how horizontal markup position interacts with Cnf, explaining that Cnf involves first order horizontal markovization. The lecture also touched on the use of different models like unigram, bigram, and trigram, and the concept of interpolation, which involves having multiple models. The lecture concluded by introducing another lexical semantic relation called homonomy. The lecture also introduced synecdoche, a specific type of metonymy involving whole-part relations, such as "all hands on deck" meaning all crew members. The lecture concluded with a promise to explore algorithms for word sense disambiguation in the future.

Today, we will review the Lccrf and also the most performance Rnn architecture. Then we discuss a support vector machine. And also we discussed artificial, neural, network, artificial neural network. The idea of recurring run network is that you have different states. And that you want to be able to compute all the States and all the outputs. Shidan Javaheri: I feel you would capture the context of the entire thing that's being said, and then give the output in a response. We can try to store a lot of information there to be able to capture long dependencies between words. You need to be careful to have all this information within a certain range.

Lectures 10 and 11 will be on artificial neural networks and recurrent neural networks. The reading assignments will be posted on Friday, October 11th. If you have questions on the reading assignments, please post on it and I will try to answer. Today's lecture will be from Professor Jackie Sean. Lstm is a type of neural network that can be used for machine translation. Lstm can be combined with Crm to create a powerful model. It can also be used to capture different context of information. It's very important for tax part of speed, tagging name extra recognition, chunking.

Long, short term memory networks is the most popular and the most used. for part of speed tagging. You can also, define features for other tasks any other tasks. And we also showed how you can find the close form. , if we are interested in the previous tag of P, part of speech to determine what will be the current act. Rns, you can have an approximate inference. David Ifeoluwa Adelani: for our end. let's assume you want to output a word here. if you use the softmax function, then you need, an algorithm to decide which one. these are -defined ways to select the one to be predicted. Shidan Javaheri: I had imagined that would also be helpful for large from language modeling. David Ifeoluwa Adelani: That is one way to think about it. for the second, for the 1st one here. The one on the is better.

Recurrence neural networks is the learning model which automatically learns nonlinear functions from impute to output. If you have enough data with neural networks. it's really an interesting architecture or method, because number one, it's biologically inspired. And also it can land from a large amount of data. Bi-directional Lstm is very, very simple in your standard neural network. It's a good model for it. instead of just using a simple fifall neural network at the hand. You need to pass it to a last feed forward neural network to make the final prediction.

Lstms has a way to fix that. You don't need every cell to always have an output. This is very similar to , , if you forward a talk yes, there's a question. Yes, someone is trying to type something many to one you but you need for the documents. For part of speed tagging, but which menu to menu would you use for longer? Because you feel this is not important. Lstm scores with those of the transition probabilities. You do a forward pass from every state, every cell to the other in the Lstm. And after that you can do back propagation from the element, from the Crf layer back to all the LStm layers. We have a very good understanding of this.

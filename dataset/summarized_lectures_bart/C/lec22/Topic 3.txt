We're going to talk about natural language generation. It's good to learn about them to expand your toolkit. Natural language generation and abstraction has many use cases. We can divide up Nlg into data to text versus text to text, depending on the source, the input. Almost all of the text is scripted ? That's that's natural languagegeneration. Each of these steps involves rules. the advantage of this type of system is that you have a lot of control over what happens. This is a lot more familiar to us in, the recent literature. , you have your source text , if you're doing summarization or translation. and then you have all of the tokens you've generated far. training, it will learn to respect the constraints. That's definitely a good approach to try. and then you feed that in as coefficients to some formulation where you then solve this constraint optimization problem. Another trend which is still ongoing, because it's not a solved problem by any means is to do controllable text generation.

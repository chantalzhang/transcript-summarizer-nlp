In this second approach of a neural nlg. You just assume that the pre trained language model, , can figure all of that out. What are some pros and cons of the second approach? If there's 1 poorly generated token, will it affect future? This model is very accessible. That's a positive which is with the neural approach. It is not accessible, because, . it may be different levels of accessibility. Microsoft's Chatbot was released into the wild on the Internet.

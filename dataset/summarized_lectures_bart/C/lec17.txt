Machine translation is a hard problem inferability and superior wharf hypothesis. It does not distinguish between mother and father. Some languages does not have plural and some languages they don't have. In practice, what we do is that we don't just focus on one end. details, because this is just the I'd be a model that I'm trying to split at the moment. And here we can use compute this using Emily. and the idea of using Md. using the number I made. and after that you can multiply it.

David Ifeoluwa Adelani: It's just very good at the general machine translation domain but there are some specific domains that even if you try it the current models may still fail. If you're aware of text generation a bit, you might be aware of this metric called blue score. If they don't correlate, that means the metric is bad. You have to think about things possibility of translation. Many, too many mapping is impossible to do the mapping directly. Think the past tense uses we, and the current tension is . And you have to remember. which will also be the topic of your reading assignment. each source word is aligned to 0 or one target world.

When do we expect that we'll get the grades back? It used to be a very, very difficult problem. But I'm not sure it's very difficult. Even the current models doesn't solve the task. Some of these dictionaries have been created by many linguists as low resource people. was on the hand. the idea of linguistic Olympia, this is very simple. , they can give you 2 languages. And then they give you rules of the language, and they ask you to perform a task in a language given some rules. They provide the rules based on your on your linguistic knowledge and the rules that have provided. he is language in East Africa that is morphologically rich.

Machine translation can be used to improve the quality of a translation. Different languages require or allow different morphological, synthetic, somatic discourse properties. Legal documents are different in different countries. The language you speak affects your thoughts. The early efforts early works for a set of specific pairs of sentences for direct translation. which is a parameter debate in English. because the autograph is different. because most of this language, , the Latin days English is not Latin based, but it borrows a lot of words from Latin. and then you can define a similarity function between the sentence and some of the words. and of course, you can also use some advanced dynamic programmability.

Machine translation has been there for long, but since it's a very, very old project one of the earlier versions is the Ibm model. We'll start thinking about the problem by discussing the noisy training model for empty on the IBM model. And then can you create a statistical model for machine translation? There are a lot of tricks you can use. the dynamic time working, which is for any distance. and then factors to consider for the word alignment. Another thing that is very important, especially if you move to different languages is the word order. And then, after you have known the alignment, you just produce the indices.

Inference is to make something explicit that was implicit before in language. If you say something , I want to visit the capital of Italy. and theCapital of Italy is in Rome. Then you can make an inference, which is, I want. to visit Rome because chances are, it'll be confusing for most of the. rest of the class. a predicate. and then you can have a function to get the capital, from Italy, from the from Italy to some other entity. Or here's another logical sentence that all wugs are blorks. And there was another question, . , that's a great question. The question is where does this function of capital out come from? It's just, I'm just defining that this could take the form of a function.

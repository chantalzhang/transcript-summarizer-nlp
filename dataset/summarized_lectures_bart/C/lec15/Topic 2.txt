Compositionality is the idea that the meanings of sentences is not just some. lexical semantics might give you the meanings and behaviors of each of the individual words. This idea of compositionality is really important, because you could argue that this is what lets language be really, really flexible and useful. The approach behind Montegovian semantics is that natural language can be made as precise as logic, logical languages of our logic. We can never get away from something symbolic and logical, at least not completely. If you say all wugs are blorks and all blorks are cute, then you can conclude that all wug are cute.

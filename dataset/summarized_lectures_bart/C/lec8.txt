We'll continue our discussion about part of speech tagging. And last time we are trying to compute, , , pr ovn they have various different symbols. And also, , we made that assumption which we call the Markov assumption. Here we relate this to Markov chains. The algorithm is very similar to what we are estimating previously. This is the transition probability from time step T to type, step t plus one. We don't know this parameter of T of Theta K. But we can estimate it with some random initial random values. and at the maximization stage you can get a better value.

, can you hear, me, , , I, guess, we can start Lecture 8 where we'll be talking about. that's a glory for every word in our text. And here we also talked about stats for when you're trying to build a model for this task. And similarly, for the part of speech. It's a general term that is used. And in Markov chains we talk about how we can decompose the joint probability which by has been removed from the board. And to compute it, it's very important to do this revision. Emi guardian can be used for different tasks. You can have something noun phrase that you want to tap instead of just a word. And then you have organization. if you see my gear university, this makes it an organization, and also what is the word that follows the entity. and then you also have the old tax, signifying that there is no entity East is not an entity located is not a entity.

Last time, we defined path of speech as a synthetic. , we have things nouns and examples restaurants, dinner. And also we talked about different ways of being part of speech different schemes, ? who can remind me of the different schemes? We examine 2 popular schemes? where we use nlp for proper nouns. and for universal dependency. what is the Gedian variable? When you're searching for an important thing on the web, you want to get the entity that you can get the information. Here you're not only annotating a single word. when we have different schemes for named entity, recognition. We also have other skills , there's another one BIOE.

Scheme, and then there's a universal one. Here we , this is an example of the pantry bank scheme. And why, what was the motivation for having a more universal dependency scheme? try to generalize across other languages. you need to consider the current world if you want to compute the mle. I will show you the offer, the forward algorithm again, in forward algorithm, everything is already integrated. The last stage you just need to marginalize over what you have at the end. And in the backward algorithm you still have your initial state probabilities, and then you have your probability of emitting the 1st word. T from the forward algorithm and the beta I of T from the backwater guardian, which we multiply together. We want to compute new values for, alphas! where we have the joint counts divided by the count over the initial states. And here you are trying to compute what is the transition probabilities.

The part of speech depends on the previous part ofspeech. This Emily, is often calculated over your corpus. which is the map, we want to estimate what will be the theta. And this data can be calculated by examining all the possible states that can happen when you're trying to go from one part of. speech to the other. In the unsupervised setting, you cannot estimate this. as long as you are making progress, that the likelihood over your observe or your training data, which is all your observation. That you calculate are your betters. The only supervised setting is about vash a guardian with no labor data often gives very poor results.

Scheme, and then there's a universal one. Here we , this is an example of the pantry bank scheme. And why, what was the motivation for having a more universal dependency scheme? try to generalize across other languages. you need to consider the current world if you want to compute the mle. I will show you the offer, the forward algorithm again, in forward algorithm, everything is already integrated. The last stage you just need to marginalize over what you have at the end. And in the backward algorithm you still have your initial state probabilities, and then you have your probability of emitting the 1st word. T from the forward algorithm and the beta I of T from the backwater guardian, which we multiply together. We want to compute new values for, alphas! where we have the joint counts divided by the count over the initial states. And here you are trying to compute what is the transition probabilities.

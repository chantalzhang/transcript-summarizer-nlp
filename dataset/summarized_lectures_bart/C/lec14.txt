It's the study of meaning as they relate to the lexicon. lexical comes from lexicon, which is this idea that we have some mental storage of entries related to language. You collect a corpus involving lots of instances of the word hand, and then you ask annotators to label each of those contexts. After that you feed that into some classifier. Hearst patterns depend on both of those words occurring in the same context. You would not be able to use Hearst patterns to extract a relation between went extinct and died out because they would not co-occur. And hyper and flexible semantic relations of some types.

We're gonna cover 3, 4 algorithms. And algorithm number 2, we're going to introduce an idea called bootstrapping. The idea is to use some weak signal to train a weak model. It's a model that is independent and can do its own thing and doesn't need help. Reinforcement learning is a learning paradigm for training a model where the assumption is that you have some reward signal that helps you modify the model's parameters. The problem, the phenomenon itself is not very understood. We're going to cover the 4th algorithm or task area for today. There, that's 1 area where you do need data. word embeddings are these trained vector space representations of words to predict words in context. You have a target word vector which is the row vector in the term context matrix. Researchers, Omar Levi showed that the skip ground model in particular, is equivalent to a version of the count based model.

The idea of lemmatizing and counting lemmetized Lemma overlap is, is implementing that idea. This is how the model pulls itself up by its own bootstraps. It gradually improves itself through multiple rounds of training on automatically labeled data. Is this considered unsupervised or semi-supervised? It depends who you ask. Learning is more the particular machine learning, optimization, paradigm or technique that you apply in order to change the model parameters. The idea of bootstrapping with reinforcement learning. The column vector is you can consider it as the representation of a word as a context word.

We are going to continue our discussion today about lexical semantics. There are different choices you can make regarding how to represent the context itself. And then we can talk a little bit about detecting semantic relationships overall. We'll take 5 seconds, stretch, and then we'll continue, how do we find these lexical semantic relations in some words in some lexical pairs, or, other words. The idea behind Hearst patterns is that if we can identify expressions this such as then we can discover hyponym, hyperym pairs automatically. What you can do is you can have an initial seed set of words. it's 2 words in a hyponym hyperym relation. Or it's you need more than that. But , and then you go into a corpus. and then, once you have those contacts you can find which contexts are very common. And then and that's 1 iteration. matrix. And , this corresponds to the cosine of the angle between the 2 vectors. then, we'll just gather a large amount of text. We'll we'll find a feasible way to compute some version of that term context, matrix. But it turns out that things are in practice some a bit more complicated than that.

Jackie Cheung, Professor: But good evening. Disambiguation, is the task of figuring out which word sense is expressed in a particular context. I'm going to go through some algorithms again, not state of the art algorithms. But the reason that I'm presenting them is that they give you the flavor of how you can use knowledge about the problem and your intuitions and build them into computational algorithms. Algorithm was developed in the early nineties by Jarowski. Heuristic is to pick one other word that will correlate and co-occur with that sense with very, very high probability. In modern times, though we solve harder problems , and not just the binary word sense disambiguation. The general idea here is that you understand a term by the distribution of words that appear near that term. You can compute some that . and the most common function that people computes to compare the meanings of 2 words is by computing their cosine similarity. If you see a word that occurs a lot with in or at or something, it's a time, word or location. The problem is that word. Vectors have no objective inherent value that we can evaluate if you had 2 vectors for the word linguistics, is point 4.3 negative point 2 better? All we can do is evaluate the similarity of vectors to each other by similarity. And then you can do a correlation. You can compute a correlation between them to check whether it's the case that the higher the similarity, according to your word vectors, the high the similarity.

Lecture 6. today we'll be talking about smoothing. someone asked a question last time about this, and then I can explain in details about what is called smoothed. I , I will just do a review of how we evaluate language models. Lambda. if you sum up all K equations from step 3, which is the step 3. You're gonna have what you have on line 5. And here you can also say that Line 4, which. is submission of are all theta I's equals to one. You divide accounts by what's the total size of the corpus. then you average a trade off. Between what corpus am I going to use to build my language model for this language. Is it a very big one or a very small one? The more data you have oftentimes the better it is. But for statistical language model.

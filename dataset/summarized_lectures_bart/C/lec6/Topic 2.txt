David Ifeoluwa Adelani: If you always make your probability to be equal 0, then it's going to ruin your estimate every time. If you roll a die it can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. If the probability is monotonically increasing, then you have to multiply it by the derivative. And by this we can also derive a realized mle or the optimal mle for the data we are looking for. To modify our goal is to modify our accounts in such a way that we reserve probability. The way we compute accounts is that we say c plus one multiplied by the frequency of the count plus one divided by F of C, and an example is the following, the probability of unknown is f 1 divided by N, which is.

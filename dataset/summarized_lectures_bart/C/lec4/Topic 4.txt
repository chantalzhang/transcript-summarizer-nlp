The more data you have is just the better the performance. You can train a model for multiple tasks at the same time to solve multiple tasks. You don't need to do lemmatization and stemming and all this feature engineering again. And one of the tasks that demonstrated this is language model. Nowadays things are better because you can ask to explain the prediction. Previously, you cannot even explain what happened in the network. There's sometimes when if you incorporate domain knowledge, you can boost your performance than a lot of engineering with neural networks.

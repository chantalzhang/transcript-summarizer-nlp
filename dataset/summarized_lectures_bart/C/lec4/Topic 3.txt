If you want to do a classification task, then you still need to use a function to convert it to a probability distribution. The more data you have, the better you are going to be able to model this. And that's why if you have less data for your problem, you should just try these basic approaches. In the early 2000s we started working on word embeddings. If you are able to find a good representation for every word in your vocabulary then you don't need to levertize. There are other ways of what is called component wise vector multiplication and there are also more sophisticated options concatenation.

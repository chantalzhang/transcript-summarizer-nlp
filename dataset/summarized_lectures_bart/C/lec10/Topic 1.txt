Today, we will review the Lccrf and also the most performance Rnn architecture. Then we discuss a support vector machine. And also we discussed artificial, neural, network, artificial neural network. The idea of recurring run network is that you have different states. And that you want to be able to compute all the States and all the outputs. Shidan Javaheri: I feel you would capture the context of the entire thing that's being said, and then give the output in a response. We can try to store a lot of information there to be able to capture long dependencies between words. You need to be careful to have all this information within a certain range.

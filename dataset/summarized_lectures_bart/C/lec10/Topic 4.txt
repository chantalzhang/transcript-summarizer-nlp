Recurrence neural networks is the learning model which automatically learns nonlinear functions from impute to output. If you have enough data with neural networks. it's really an interesting architecture or method, because number one, it's biologically inspired. And also it can land from a large amount of data. Bi-directional Lstm is very, very simple in your standard neural network. It's a good model for it. instead of just using a simple fifall neural network at the hand. You need to pass it to a last feed forward neural network to make the final prediction.

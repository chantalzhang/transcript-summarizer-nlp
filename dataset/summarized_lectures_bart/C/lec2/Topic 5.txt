NLU is about analyzing the internal word structure and how words are composed. NLP is not machine learning and machine learning is not NLP. In supervised learning, a model has access to your input data as as its corresponding output label for the purposes of training. In unsupervised learning, the words B&A, they appear in similar contexts and they appear near other classes of words. Y is the easiest in the sense that you just need to have some output. OK, then in terms of the feature extraction step, feature extraction refers to taking your input textual document and then extracting features from there that you think might be relevant and useful to pass on to the classifier. Machine learning is based on something that is wrong. I'm just saying that it'll be very, very difficult to do a better job than them fast enough such that you can make money. We can still fix this by expanding the set of features. We condition on where it's where the piece of text comes from.

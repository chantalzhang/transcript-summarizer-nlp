Machine translation has been there for long, but since it's a very, very old project one of the earlier versions is the Ibm model. We'll start thinking about the problem by discussing the noisy training model for empty on the IBM model. And then can you create a statistical model for machine translation? There are a lot of tricks you can use. the dynamic time working, which is for any distance. and then factors to consider for the word alignment. Another thing that is very important, especially if you move to different languages is the word order. And then, after you have known the alignment, you just produce the indices.

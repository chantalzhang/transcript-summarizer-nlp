The idea of lemmatizing and counting lemmetized Lemma overlap is, is implementing that idea. This is how the model pulls itself up by its own bootstraps. It gradually improves itself through multiple rounds of training on automatically labeled data. Is this considered unsupervised or semi-supervised? It depends who you ask. Learning is more the particular machine learning, optimization, paradigm or technique that you apply in order to change the model parameters. The idea of bootstrapping with reinforcement learning. The column vector is you can consider it as the representation of a word as a context word.

We are going to continue our discussion today about lexical semantics. There are different choices you can make regarding how to represent the context itself. And then we can talk a little bit about detecting semantic relationships overall. We'll take 5 seconds, stretch, and then we'll continue, how do we find these lexical semantic relations in some words in some lexical pairs, or, other words. The idea behind Hearst patterns is that if we can identify expressions this such as then we can discover hyponym, hyperym pairs automatically. What you can do is you can have an initial seed set of words. it's 2 words in a hyponym hyperym relation. Or it's you need more than that. But , and then you go into a corpus. and then, once you have those contacts you can find which contexts are very common. And then and that's 1 iteration. matrix. And , this corresponds to the cosine of the angle between the 2 vectors. then, we'll just gather a large amount of text. We'll we'll find a feasible way to compute some version of that term context, matrix. But it turns out that things are in practice some a bit more complicated than that.

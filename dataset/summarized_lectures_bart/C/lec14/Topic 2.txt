We're gonna cover 3, 4 algorithms. And algorithm number 2, we're going to introduce an idea called bootstrapping. The idea is to use some weak signal to train a weak model. It's a model that is independent and can do its own thing and doesn't need help. Reinforcement learning is a learning paradigm for training a model where the assumption is that you have some reward signal that helps you modify the model's parameters. The problem, the phenomenon itself is not very understood. We're going to cover the 4th algorithm or task area for today. There, that's 1 area where you do need data. word embeddings are these trained vector space representations of words to predict words in context. You have a target word vector which is the row vector in the term context matrix. Researchers, Omar Levi showed that the skip ground model in particular, is equivalent to a version of the count based model.

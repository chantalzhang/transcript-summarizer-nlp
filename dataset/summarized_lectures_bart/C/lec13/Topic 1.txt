The system is a description of transitions between tokens other than not tokens. Instead of tokens those we'll call them non terminals. A non terminal symbol might be noun phrase, or it could be verb. rules that where the verb phrase rewrites to just the verb, because it's an intransitive verb. The scheme we just described with the background is called 1st and order. context, the current best parser, which is a neural parser, would be getting a score of around 95. These are 20 year old results. you can do this 1st and come up with a model. and then once you get to the point of parsing. And , we're gonna talk about another really big topic which is semantics. It's a function that takes in an object from the world. And then there are many, many other infinitely many other objects in the world which are not telephones. in the , whereas before you had, a function. that took in anobject and returns. And are these sufficient conditions satisfied? And then it returns to recall? it's not by an enumeration anymore. second context, something flowing and graceful would help inform that this hand is referring to the handwriting style. Second context,something flowing and gracefully would help informed that the hand was referring to a hand style. second context, a flowing hand would show that the handwriting was flowing.

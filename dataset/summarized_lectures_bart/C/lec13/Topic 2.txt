Each non terminal symbol is a syntactic category. This means that for each of these non-terminal symbols they need to rewrite it into something else. Rewrites to a personal pronoun node, or whatever. And again, you don't need to learn any linguistics to do this because this can be read off from the structure of the tree in the tree bank. doing the factorization is rather than modeling the entire thing all at once, we're not gonna do that. this process is called markovization. because we're making Markov independence assumptions. vertically speaking, that was called that would be called vertical markovizations. And then here's the horizontal Markovizations markup order of , here's a standard Pcfg with infinite context. Linguistics is about how the meanings of words relate to each other. In Wordnet, there are 6 different synsets associated with the word syns. You can have, physical whole part relations, such as a car has a whole part and a windshield is not a car. meal laid out on it. This is a this is a metonym which has become conventionalized that it's listed as a separate sense. it's it's a blissimous thing. , this is how it's organized. You can look at Member maronyms. And then you can look up synsets in Wordnet. figuring out which word sense is expressed in context.

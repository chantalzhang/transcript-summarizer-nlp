Co-reference is the relation between a referring expression and its 2 different mentions in the passage. Co-reference chains are about the direct directly pointing to the same real world entity. In this example, I have that cat or whiskers, or something furry, or it. and they all point to thesame cat. And that's the phenomenon of co-reference. Algorithm uses context and world knowledge to figure out what's happening. In English, we have at least 2 to 3, 3 grammatical genders. We tend to refer to things multiple times. And you it would not be usual to , refer to, present something and then not talk about it for a while, and then refer to it again suddenly. some initial syntactic parsing, and you restrict possible spans to, according to the syntax tree, or something that. , you mentioned 2 sub networks almost as if, , there are 2 parts of the network with 2 different outputs. And then after that, they're the sub networks. It's inspired by the same idea. one of my Phd students, Ian Parada compared encoder and decoder models. and we find that encoder models tend to be more efficient and perform better.

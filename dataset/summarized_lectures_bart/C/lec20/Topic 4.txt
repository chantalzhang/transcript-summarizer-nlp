Natural language doesn't occur as individual sentences or individual utterances one at a time. There are relations between different sentences or utterances. They're called discourse relations between clauses and sentences and passages. Coherence is defined at the level of logical relationships between sentences or smaller chunks. cohesion is the observable mechanisms that link together these chunks of text. The algorithm itself is quite complex, with quite a bit of detail at a high level. But you can expect, the proportion of times to get this rate to be 60%, 50, 60%. Any ideas for how you might solve these set these up as machine learning tasks that you could train a system to solve. This ete model is quite highly performing more recently than the more recent developments, as you would expect is to do something similar, but with a transformer style. Then the second class of new models that have been proposed is what was mentioned earlier. This was supposed to come later. And this gets a much better performance.

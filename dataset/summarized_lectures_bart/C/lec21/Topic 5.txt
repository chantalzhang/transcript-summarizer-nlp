This week we're gonna look a little bit at automatic summarization and text generation. We're gonna talk about some of the ideas that have been important these fields. And different techniques that you want to employ, depending on what you're trying to do. and score terms, and then, after that, you can just directly use those scores, and score each of your sentences by say, it's average, or its total tf, idf weighting. or I idf score ? and then for each term, Ti. And each term is either the term of interest. Ti, or it's not theterm of interest some other term. What you can ask, what is the probability that occurrences of Ti are distributed between R and not R in this way? this is a binomial distribution.

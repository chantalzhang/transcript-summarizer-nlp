Part of speech used to be a very important task in the 90s because it was very essential for many applications from machine translation to speech recognition and many tasks, and also for named entity recognition. And we are having an NLP workshop, NLP in the era of generative AI. why would you want to do that? , you can, but why? , this is our model. , but of course you can do that. But say that it doesn't depend, it's false, ? The probability of an outcome is that you count all the outcomes and then you divide by all the events. Is that what you got? What is the transition probabilities from VBD to preposition, to iron?

Lecture 7. today we are going to be talking about part of speech tagging. You can no longer attend in person, but you can attend online if you register . today also last time last week we discussed about language modeling. We talk about smoothing techniques that you can address words. And it's also a popular feature. Don't know the part of speech that is an hidden variable because you don't know it at this time. given a part of. speech, you can generate different words that can fit that part. of speech. Can you predict what would be the. part ofspeech and test time? if we unroll it, the time steps. What's the probability that the noun is going to emit a car, which is the word times?

Part of speech tagging as a sequence labeling problem. English language is following the structure of SVO. There are other tasks that are sequence labeling, name density recognition. And you can do this for different languages, for different data sets or for different domains. You have to 1st have the initial probability, which is the probability of DT multiplied by. The two things you said I cannot, what's the difference? And then, All , in terms of the inference, how do we do the inference that we have a model? Peter said he will be responsible for the experiment section.

We have an NLP workshop at Miller. Miller is the Montreal AI institute. Why do you need to smooth? giving a sequence a sequence of words. Then we're going to examine some things coming from motivated, from probability theory. OK, what is a noun is a name of a person, Anima. part of speech tag covering 37 categories including punctuation. Model is a very simple bigram. If you want to say what is the probability of D is the terminal, then car is a noun and of is preposition and is noun with a plural and then ran is a verb that is in the past tense. And then you repeat the same thing because this is a bigram model.

The idea of hidden Markov models, which used to be very popular until deep learning overtook it. We have prepositions very, very common stop words in of up above. And then you have a verb which is worse here. And here you have the hamburger is dash than that one. This is the way we model it. And we are modeling both parts of speech and words together. In the very simplified 1, you can estimate all these probabilities very similar to how we estimate all the probabilities for naive base. You can estimate the initial probability distribution and you can also estimate the emission probability. And then we have all these algorithms, forward algorithm, backward algorithm, Viterbi algorithm that we're going to discuss in the class.

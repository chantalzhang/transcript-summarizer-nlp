Language models that they try to scale, to 500 languages, but in terms of performance we I don't think we have a good luck with that. It's more on multilingual nlp and crosslingual transfer. We have this collaborative projects where we have native speakers and Mls. And then we have 2 versions of the Masaka Project. language is covered in multilingual birth. the lesson is, I try to cover as many scripts during pre-training, that you will be it will be easier to adapt to new languages in the future. How the sound are they related to each other. We have the futura distance, which is a combination of all these distance measures. for you to do transfer learning.

The talk will focus on the challenges of developing machine learning models for low resource languages such as African languages. The first challenge is to create data sets that cover different tasks from question answering text to speech sentiment, classification, machine translation, news topic, part of speech, name, density, recognition. The talk will also look at how the models can be adapted to different languages. Chatgpt just 1 min had much worse results than just training on English. The Tokenizer also doesn't work very for this ? if a language is not same, and there's no relative or causing then it's gonna give you a poor result. We have bite level models, which I did better. Can you speak louder, can you one? to predict what would be the best transfer language for a new language. We have, Nigerian pigeon and Yoruba with predicted if we use the brute force approach. But we still have Yoruba. That was also predicted for hours, even by the language RAM model. If you train on the top 2 predicted languages, you'll find out all the time.

David Ifeoluwa Adelani: There's still a lot of work to be done. we could also speed them. what's the size of if you crawl all the available web tests in that language? Oh, better tax specific one. class 0, these are . , and class one would be languages that have few texts. And then the winners are languages with sufficient amounts of labor data and legal data. Mlp. which shows that the transfer learning works but is not better than a single most layer perception. The only language we see improvement in performance is English, because the model is already good for English. And if you want to apply this approach to other languages, you have to do the same thing. continue pre-training on a large amount of text for that new language, and then do the instruction fine tuning. And then also on Chinese mmu, you also have some boost in performance by this. You train a model on English, anyhow. and each map transfers call this. And here I'm just going to display some results that are more specific to Africa. Arabic German, we see some interesting transfer to some African languages.

There are over 7,000 languages in the world, and or over 400 of them, are spoken by 1 million speakers. But we don't have a single technology that works for 400 languages per world. The problem is that you cannot really do have a good, successful, self-supervised training. Siv 200 is a language embedding tool for the web. It can be used to learn different languages. It is based on the Bible, but it can also be used for question, answering task or reading comprehension. Siv 200 uses a number of different models to learn a language. , and they have a random platforms. And here we're able to cover more regions of Africa with a better multilingual representation, learning model. The model is also very big, and up to half of the model size is in the embedding part of themodel.

Some languages are not supported by keyboard spell checkers, morphological analyzers and dictionaries. There's lack of legal data for downstream task and also for many languages. Europe and European languages have been more favored because they are one of the early adopters of the Internet technology. , but this is not interesting. Yes, we do have character level models. One of the issues is, many but also there's other restrictions where models are just getting bigger, bigger, and then nobody can serve them. But one thing you can do about this is to do what is called adaptive fine tuning. , you can replace the vocabulary completely. that's the end of the ledger. Thank you for waiting till the end. , Jackie, with the go ahead. That's it for this edition of The Daily Mail's Q&A with the Editor-in-Chief of The Mail on Sunday.

In the past lectures we have examined. How can we model language far in context of test classification? Some people are able to join. how, how to do , on downstream tasks. And then we have examine. , common feature instruction strategies destroy much of the information in the text message. The longer model can also predict an incorrect fat. you prefer that it suggests what's for you when you're typing. It's an example of a simple language model which is sentence completion. ASR is a very a big application of language model and also machine translation. typically we find a solution that maximizes a combination of tax-specific quality.

David Ifeoluwa Adelani: North campus. I will skip the review of last time. Because we use bags of engrams. We don't really care about the order. we can use and grams instead of considering one word, we can consider 2 words that follow each other. We can compute what is called word frequency, or we, the popular word that we use is what iscalled time frequency. to estimate how much information in bits. information of X in slide 36 equals the log of 2 of one over B of X. and entropy is just what is the expectation? What is the expected amount of information we can get while observing a random variable? Then you can have a very high expected value of the information.

be discussing Engram language model. We do not fully care about the context of the of the words, we only treat them as bag of words or bag of engrams. Then we're going to examine more statistical language modeling based on n grams, and then we'll do or maximum likelihood by relative frequency. Can you compute a unigram and background language model, using the following sentence? Yes, you have to tokenize it , and the choice of tokenization can be. That is probability of is that you are going to take them 2 by twos. And that is how you have 2 over 5.

Language model is a way to predict the probability of a word based on all the words in the purpose. It can also factor in the context or the previous words before the word we're trying to predict. The word that is infrequent might be around 30,000. There are many applications of language model. before we make this more complicated. I all of you are more focusing on what's the problem, what we have go to the one. after you have feed the data using parameter theta on everything on your training purpose, how do you compare? and then you can also use publicity. And there's a nice connection between cross entropy and publicity.

I want to remind you of what is the word which you know? , but the problem is that it's not very easy to determine sometimes. You have a root word, and then you can append to the left or to the how that some language is, just keep, append it to this suffix, just skip. And then, if a word is infrequent also, what will happen? if you have this inverse relationship, that means you have to introduce a constant. defined. here in the cross entropy, . and the cross entropy is also defined this way. The cross entropy is also defined this way in the cross entropy, which is defined as the sum of the intermittent entities of the two sub-entities in the same way.

Last week we described how to come up with features for your classifier. Today we'll talk about how to train a classifier on a training set. The idea there are two assumptions, but the most important assumption is this independence assumption. And once you have done that you can optimize this likelihood using gradient descent.  support vector machine is a very, very important algorithm. Given enough training data, they tend to perform very well. For current language models, people are trading for over six months, over a year. It's really expensive and often requires a lot of data.

Co-reference is the relation between a referring expression and its 2 different mentions in the passage. Co-reference chains are about the direct directly pointing to the same real world entity. In this example, I have that cat or whiskers, or something furry, or it. and they all point to thesame cat. And that's the phenomenon of co-reference. Algorithm uses context and world knowledge to figure out what's happening. In English, we have at least 2 to 3, 3 grammatical genders. We tend to refer to things multiple times. And you it would not be usual to , refer to, present something and then not talk about it for a while, and then refer to it again suddenly. some initial syntactic parsing, and you restrict possible spans to, according to the syntax tree, or something that. , you mentioned 2 sub networks almost as if, , there are 2 parts of the network with 2 different outputs. And then after that, they're the sub networks. It's inspired by the same idea. one of my Phd students, Ian Parada compared encoder and decoder models. and we find that encoder models tend to be more efficient and perform better.

language typically occurs in bigger chunks than individual sentences. relationships between sentences and also phenomena that cut across sentences that we want to think about. One of the ways in which we can computationally estimate whether a passage is coherent or not is to check if there are devices that link. Hobbes algorithm from the seventies is a heuristic algorithm that puts together all of these cues and comes up with a method for co-reference resolution based on that. In English the subject comes before the object, and then left to works for English. Later on we'll look at machine learning algorithms that might be able to do a better job. outputs, and forth. It gives you a score, for whether it's a mention or not, and you can do that, do supervised learning on this. , what they do is they implement the proposal that we had from the class earlier, which is, you pass it a passage and then extracts a bunch of mentions, and it also extracts what these mentions point to previously in the context.

If you have coherent passages, will you always find cohesive devices between them? You'll find cohesive links between. these are called anaphoric devices. But it's hard to model this and do this for impractical settings, because, . one thing that you could do that is still useful is Co-reference. We learn with hearse patterns. you're saying that Hearst patterns might give you patterns that help you figure out co-reference links. that would be more for the whole problem. , yes, would any sequence modeling framework work for this task. But you could it would output a probability there or something being mentioned or not.

Natural language doesn't occur as individual sentences or individual utterances one at a time. There are relations between different sentences or utterances. They're called discourse relations between clauses and sentences and passages. Coherence is defined at the level of logical relationships between sentences or smaller chunks. cohesion is the observable mechanisms that link together these chunks of text. The algorithm itself is quite complex, with quite a bit of detail at a high level. But you can expect, the proportion of times to get this rate to be 60%, 50, 60%. Any ideas for how you might solve these set these up as machine learning tasks that you could train a system to solve. This ete model is quite highly performing more recently than the more recent developments, as you would expect is to do something similar, but with a transformer style. Then the second class of new models that have been proposed is what was mentioned earlier. This was supposed to come later. And this gets a much better performance.

Today's lecture also relates to the reading assignment the 4th reading assignment which has been posted. We're 1st going to talk a little bit about discourse and think about and talk about some basic distinctions in the field of discourse. And we're going to focus on one particular phenomenon related to discourse, which is co-reference resolution. We can also analyze the structure that is there at the level of the whole discourse. Hobbes algorithm searches the current sentence where you find the pronoun to left, starting at the pronoun. It then tries to find an antecedent that matches in terms of number and gender using the syntax tree. In order to find a noun phrase that matches, Hobbes searches the order in which nodes in the in the syntax trees are searched. The algorithm would encounter a noun phrase first. It would not ever propose a beautiful cupcake or the patisserie window on their own. It encounters the 1st noun phrase that it does that matches a number and gender. And then, a huge noun phrase. And , the other examples are similar.

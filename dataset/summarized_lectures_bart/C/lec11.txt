, we're talking about universities that you're you're pumped and that you are open. is it doing the 11th , when I checked and my courses was the top. We're going to look at some particular characteristics or properties of English syntax themselves. And then we're also gonna look at a formal system for describing structure called context-free grammars. Natural language can be thought of as sets of a set of string. We're going to use a more powerful class of formal grammars. These are in particular context, free grammar. These become 3 separate symbols in our system. And we can do that. Grammars are just a different view of the hierarchical structure of language. It shares this basic property and assumption that it that it's hierarchical. A noun can be 1st or second or 3rd person. And that's really cool because it's a computational model.

There are many different kinds of constituents in a sentence. There are some strings that are accepted by the language, say English. And then there are other strings which are not accepted, and they don't form valid English sentences. This is a valid sentence is avalid sentence, a sentence, this valid is, is not a invalid sentence. Computational linguistics is the study of how sentences are written. In English, a sentence should be rewritten into a noun phrase, plus a verb phrase. We write to something a verb, and there are some options for that as . It means, or , a verb can be to is a verb. It's a very simple grammar. This rules which is accepted by this grammar. Parsing with empty elements becomes intractable because you have to posit all possible combinations of up to infinite number of empty elements everywhere in your sentence. At most, I will have, this, many empty elements in a row, or something that. In fact, this is just a shorthand. This is 6 different rules.

Grammarians from South Asia developed a grammar for Sanskrit, which is a classical language of South Asia. It's quite possible that the informal or casual version of a language has a different grammar compared to the formal version. If someone asks who beat you up, you cannot answer the muscles from that's not a constituent. Grammar is made up of a noun phrase plus a verb phrase. It's not accepted currently by the grammar. A Cfg is a four-tuple because we have 3 options. A Vp is the verb phrase, and then it gives you . But the really interesting thing here is that you can have it. 4 that causes this whole thing to be a prepositional phrase. you can directly tell here that there's a subject relation with this arc. To the left of some Vp or something, and that's quite complex. Also, you can convert between them. You can merge it with 4 . And finally, you have studied.

Jackie Cheung, Professor: It sounds nothing. that means there are no classes or office hours or lectures. The reading assignments are not meant to take a long time there, but they are there, those to help complement the material that we discuss in the course. If you need any help in finding final project members, if you haven't started thinking about that yet we will provide help for that. In this context language simply refers to the set of strings that you want to accept. You start off with a starting symbol which for us will be the S. and you apply the rules of a Csg. that's part of the language described by this grammar another one is this, rocks. English has a very limited amount of subject-verb agreements in the present tense. The only thing we really have to fix is, we need to ensure that if you have a singular 3rd person. , let's fix that part of the grammar. We want to have rules that check and ensure for correspondences between the features and different parts of your sentence.

In this course, we're only going to be concerned with descriptive grammars. We need to have some standards that people can communicate with each other efficiently. A constituent is a group of words or other constituents that behave as a unit. They share some similar distributional properties that we can test for. A formal grammar is a set of rules and other associated things that help you generate a set. of strings that make up a language. In natural languages, where multiple constituents and some categorizations and other phenomena. can be used to account for these and other syntactic concerns. In a dependency grammar, you draw arrows directed directed edges to connect and describe this relation. The advantage of talking about dependencies as opposed to constituents is that it exposes the syntactic relations, the grammatical relations much more easily. And if you're interested in understanding the semantic relations between words and noun phrases, you need this information.

David Ifeoluwa Adelani: How do you decide on what would be your candidates? we have some work that have been developed also at University of Montreal and one of the authors of the attention mechanism is still around. We have transformers and landing models, and we'll talk a little bit about prompting. a sentence. until you train the model, they don't mean they don’t capture any information. But this tutorial was very, very helpful. , because you need to be able to encode the word very , and it's either from a separate model, word to back, or the model starts with one hot encoding and learns its own. keys and values are just lined.

When you want to predict the world they are. There's nothing technical about prompting, but there's there's some ways you can do prompting that will give you better results. We'll talk about a modification of this, we where an attention is introduced. One word at a time. , when it 1st came on, nobody understood it. We want to know that if you have thinking machines. Is it thinking or machines? and then you do that for machines. and then we normalize it and then apply softmax. It believes that thinking is more important, ?

In a retriever system, you have, you want to query. And then you need a key to access the information, and then you add the value. In practice, query, key and values are just randomly initialized vectors. But once you have the structure of computing the attention which I can pull up the formula, and it's still relevant to today of more than 6 years ago. language model just with that single example which we will call one shot. The language model will be able to solve the task of sentiment classification. if you give it another example. the interesting thing is that almost all Nlp tasks, I would say, oh, I don't see any tasks that cannot be converted. you apply a noise function to your text to mark something out. And it's gonna give you every task.

Today we'll talk about attention mechanism, , which will bridge the discussion from Rnn and Lstms to the transformer. And also we'll touch on some important concepts , how do you get your Machine translation output, because when you're trying to decode from the decoder side or any other model you use, you need some authorities. We want to learn a distribution over words to decide how important each word is in order to compute the representation of the layer. Instead of starting with one hard encoding, we start with the embedding of a different model. And this is the idea of multi-year edition. you're learning 8 different key value queries. on unlabeled text, and you have what is called self-supervised training, and the task for the for the birds model is just predict the missing token, which is a Max token. We also have a multilingual version of this that was trained on, , one on one language and a lot of data, 6.3 trillion tokens. And you can cast any task as a text generation task.

, , today we'll be talking about neural machine translations. That's you have different words that are equally probable. Words that you will produce? And the interesting thing is, some of these techniques have been developed. There's no need to care about the likelihood, the likelihood of fertility, . because you don't have a direct translation of that word. We're still using transformer architecture since 2017, and the title of the paper, which attention is all you need. It seems to work to. it still has some issues in modeling long context dependencies. And then you can allow flow of information from one world to the other, because everything is you're computing just mattress multiplication.

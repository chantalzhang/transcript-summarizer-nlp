In this course, we're only going to be concerned with descriptive grammars. We need to have some standards that people can communicate with each other efficiently. A constituent is a group of words or other constituents that behave as a unit. They share some similar distributional properties that we can test for. A formal grammar is a set of rules and other associated things that help you generate a set. of strings that make up a language. In natural languages, where multiple constituents and some categorizations and other phenomena. can be used to account for these and other syntactic concerns. In a dependency grammar, you draw arrows directed directed edges to connect and describe this relation. The advantage of talking about dependencies as opposed to constituents is that it exposes the syntactic relations, the grammatical relations much more easily. And if you're interested in understanding the semantic relations between words and noun phrases, you need this information.

Programming assignment one will be released. Will we be building our own model? It could be naive base, it could be logistic regression. neural network, perceptron, SVM, anything. We are operating on discrete values. It's either a cat or a dog. It does not mean you have a definition of your vocabulary. there's no notion of similarity. And that's why nowadays we focus more on sentence representation. And if the language model is able to fill in the gap properly, that means it has learned a very good representation of many words in the large text composure provided. And this concept is very related to transfer learning, which I will cover in 2 minutes.

In logistic regression, you want to look for a certain weight that allows you to model your input X to give you Y. In the feedforward neural network, I've been talking about weight matrices or your weights. It's a learning model which automatically learns nonlinear functions from input to output. The more data we have, neural network has not disappeared because it is able to model any function. SVM can also work for nonlinear data if you use kernel functions. You need a non linear function that can separate your data. Size of your output depends on the size of your entire vocabulary, the number of types that you have. In the case of language model, your input vocabulary size is equal to your output vocabulary size. The loss function is used to know how far away are you from the words from the correct answer. One of the algorithms that's used till today is back propagation and one of different artists talk they have tried to replace it but they have not found a good alternative to. Do nowadays based on neural networks, you're going to start with a pre trained model. For each class you compute the F1 score and then you have equal weights for both of them. Another difficult thing is that neural networks tends to work very , but it's difficult to interpret. There are many open questions on how to use linguistic structure.

If you want to do a classification task, then you still need to use a function to convert it to a probability distribution. The more data you have, the better you are going to be able to model this. And that's why if you have less data for your problem, you should just try these basic approaches. In the early 2000s we started working on word embeddings. If you are able to find a good representation for every word in your vocabulary then you don't need to levertize. There are other ways of what is called component wise vector multiplication and there are also more sophisticated options concatenation.

The more data you have is just the better the performance. You can train a model for multiple tasks at the same time to solve multiple tasks. You don't need to do lemmatization and stemming and all this feature engineering again. And one of the tasks that demonstrated this is language model. Nowadays things are better because you can ask to explain the prediction. Previously, you cannot even explain what happened in the network. There's sometimes when if you incorporate domain knowledge, you can boost your performance than a lot of engineering with neural networks.

All , today we'll move to Lecture 4, which will be on nonlinear classifiers. Very briefly, who can remind me what we do? OK, there's another one . the data set is very similar to the test sets, but you still have to do the calculation. And there are a lot of smotting techniques that we typically use in NLP. These two definitions, ? Just give me one minute. GPT can do many things. It needs a lot, a lot of data and by you should be aware of that. Also, there are many hyper parameters to tune. There's no notion of interpretability. And when is linguistic feature engineering good?

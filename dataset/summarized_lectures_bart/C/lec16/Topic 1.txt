We're in the setting of syntax-driven semantic composition. and that when you do a syntactic composition by applying a rule in your context-free grammar.

Expert: Students don't really do reasoning and logic and they often don't do when it comes to thinking about how many entities and how many things there are in a particular context. arguably, that's because they don't think about things logically. You can also imagine defining a new constant for King of France, just for proper nouns.

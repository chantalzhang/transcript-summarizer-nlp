The syntax part is you combine things to make a bigger syntactic chunk. You also do function application to build up a bigger piece of the meaning representation for the whole constituents. There's a whole series of reasoning steps you can derive to show that this is the way that you need to make to make all the representations look more similar to each other in form. In Bertrand Russell's logic, there is an entity that is the student. And a smart student is at the intersection of them. The question is, what is gonna be the rule for smart, the adjective smart. syntactically, it will be something adjective rewrites to smart. s. 1 here is associated with for all students, because it's the students who are taking the courses. There exists a Y course Y, and that's associated with S. 2 with the second entry in your storage. When you have the extra information, you can take things out of storage, and then recombine recombine them with the meaning representations.

We're in the setting of syntax-driven semantic composition. and that when you do a syntactic composition by applying a rule in your context-free grammar. And semantically, you're also combining things to build a bigger meaning chunk of meaning representation. And in our case it's 1st order logic. Expert: Students don't really do reasoning and logic and they often don't do when it comes to thinking about how many entities and how many things there are in a particular context. arguably, that's because they don't think about things logically. You can also imagine defining a new constant for King of France, just for proper nouns.

Jackie Cheung, Professor: Each word at the leaf of the tree is associated with some fragment of meaning representation in the logic that we care about. And then and then this rules E part. that's why we do this complex thing of of this is called reification. But the concept is the same. semantically, it should not matter, for if all the adjectives are the majority class of these are called subsective adjectives. But it's that they're faking with respect to the specific property of studenthood studentness. And for that reason, semantically, you cannot take this approach of modeling as a conjunction of multiple predicates. And if you, if you dutifully work through all of the syntactic compositions with the semantic attachments. that's a problem with our current approach.

The syntax part is you combine things to make a bigger syntactic chunk. You also do function application to build up a bigger piece of the meaning representation for the whole constituents. There's a whole series of reasoning steps you can derive to show that this is the way that you need to make to make all the representations look more similar to each other in form. In Bertrand Russell's logic, there is an entity that is the student. And a smart student is at the intersection of them. The question is, what is gonna be the rule for smart, the adjective smart. syntactically, it will be something adjective rewrites to smart. s. 1 here is associated with for all students, because it's the students who are taking the courses. There exists a Y course Y, and that's associated with S. 2 with the second entry in your storage. When you have the extra information, you can take things out of storage, and then recombine recombine them with the meaning representations.

We're going to expand our grammar a little bit to account for several other phenomena. We're gonna talk about more kinds of verbs, and then we're also going to talk about quantifiers. We've done intransitive verbs and transitive verbs. The last step to get to the sentence level is the same. Bertrand Russell said there exists an X such that p of x, and . It means that there's a there exists a uniqueX such that . How did we come up with this rule? And then we need to write it what he said. First, st it has to exist, a unique thing. And if it's unique, that means everything else that has that predicate must be that thing. 1st reading. We want an underspecified representation that is compatible with both readings. After you've read the whole syllabus, and then you can go back to retrieve and derive the corrects disambiguated meaning representation. The under specified representation for every student took a course.

Lambdas are there to help you figure out or to express that you're still missing information. And then, when you do more syntactic composition, then you combine more pieces of meaning representation together. And all of these steps is applications of Lambdas. But again, conceptually, it's exactly the same. Pnq, the A is the existential. , let me say that this is what we're aiming for. My question is, what is the semantic attachment for that. And we figure this out assuming that there's some other rule that combines nouns with adjectives. Can other people see the issue?

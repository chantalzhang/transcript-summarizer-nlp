You have a root word, and then you can append to the left or to the how that some language is, just keep, append it to this suffix, just skip. And then, if a word is infrequent also, what will happen? if you have this inverse relationship, that means you have to introduce a constant. defined. here in the cross entropy, . and the cross entropy is also defined this way. The cross entropy is also defined this way in the cross entropy, which is defined as the sum of the intermittent entities of the two sub-entities in the same way.

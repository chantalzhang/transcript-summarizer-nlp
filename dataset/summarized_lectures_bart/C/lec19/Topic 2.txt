The talk will focus on the challenges of developing machine learning models for low resource languages such as African languages. The first challenge is to create data sets that cover different tasks from question answering text to speech sentiment, classification, machine translation, news topic, part of speech, name, density, recognition. The talk will also look at how the models can be adapted to different languages. Chatgpt just 1 min had much worse results than just training on English. The Tokenizer also doesn't work very for this ? if a language is not same, and there's no relative or causing then it's gonna give you a poor result. We have bite level models, which I did better. Can you speak louder, can you one? to predict what would be the best transfer language for a new language. We have, Nigerian pigeon and Yoruba with predicted if we use the brute force approach. But we still have Yoruba. That was also predicted for hours, even by the language RAM model. If you train on the top 2 predicted languages, you'll find out all the time.

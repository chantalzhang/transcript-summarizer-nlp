        "And then there's  interesting that certainly doesn't. Do you prefer the captions, or are they distracting? And then I'll turn it over to David. we have the following, Tas Shira Zilling, Guaraff Shi, jun. Released an updated version this August. There's no fine for this one. There's no one, is there? The the Gopaja will be the final exam exactly. How many people know my courses? I'm programming needs to be done in python. We have some prerequisite for this call. I believe many people here should be familiar with python programming. you should take it very serious. a quarter of your grid. a topic  that and consult a list of suggested projects to be posted. paper project proposal, and then you have the progress update and the final submission. Yes, this is a very important one. you can use it if it assist you. If it helps you to understand course materials  it. Fine to search for information or brainstorm, . If you only generate all your solutions. Reassignment from this we're going to detect. But for the assignment and project submissions will be on my courses. if you have confused, you're not in . You're in the same boat with many other people. our artificial Lambo process still remains 10 years away. 3 years after what happened during this time? language model is a very, very simple concept that has been a statistical Nlp for many, many years. and we even have statistical language models before the neural language models where you can pick a small chunk of text. And the key insight is that you learn correlations between words. for many page generation capacity. Why did people try methods? we started from statistical language model and statistical Nlp before moving into the new architectures. Why do people try the methods that they did? f, 1 score that some of you may be already familiar with  more application specific ones  Broscore or Krf. I'm sure there will be other courses. close to half of the world, languages are  endangered. And it is nearly universal. And this distinction is quite interesting that in both core Nlp. Also a lot of statistical methods and machine learning. How they can be usable for machines and humans for different tasks. image captioning can be also referred to as text generation task, even though the infuses image. is this what I'm supposed to stop? Or, , ,  a few more stuff. Here we have the nature of language. Propose a universal grammar for language on are here. That's what init knowledge most children already have in order to learn their mother tongue. the nature of language processing some sentences are supposed to be gammatical, correct. but are difficult to process. that you all agree that the second sentence is not very grammatically correct, and then you have the rats, the cat, the dog chased, caught escape. in language processing, , some sentences are supposed to be what grammatically correct. But if they're not grammatical, grammatically correct, it's very difficult for us to process. the last slide here that will cover the mathematical foundations of sale, mathematical properties of formal system and algorithm. Why design designing the algorithm. I will stop here and you can pass. I gather it's cool these days to , hold the microphone in your hand. , , in terms of the type of language. It's just that there are additional issues there or different issues there that we won't cover in this course. ASR,  automatic speech recognition is we. We've also had tremendous progress in that by using deep learning techniques there sometimes is a perception that is a solved problem. At least, that's the core. At least I won't take any stand about whether these divisions are  there, but at least they're still useful to it's still useful to have these divisions for us to be able to more easily talk about different phenomena in language. And and they're roughly organized by the smallest units going on to bigger and bigger chunks of units. let's take a look at this. sure, this, this sound, and very specifically what goes on in your mouth when you say the word peach, ? and vowels can also similarly be described in terms of formants,  the e can be represented in terms of the formants that make up the vowel sound. There's usually this a 2D diagram of , and you can talk about vowel heights, and whether the vowels near the front of your mouth in the back of or the back of your mouth, and  forth. in the spelling, at least peach and speech are both spelled with P.  I'm guessing that for the vast majority of you think of these as  the same ? They belong to the same abstract category. whether someone grew up speaking a language in that in French, the B's. And then you're against that. ,  there's but the point here is that there's some regular structure. , there's some correspondence between how you word pieces are built up. and  , we won't spend that much more time on morphology in this course. and  these are technical terms, grammatical or ungrammatical. The same sentence to have multiple interpretations. Do do you see it in 6 years. It's the last time you ran, it was 6 years ago. just  a sentence, can have multiple interpretations and be ambiguous. Individual words themselves can also have multiple meanings, multiple interpretations. And people have devised algorithms for that and come with data sets and evaluations. However, this curse,  this curse is, it was cast by a wizard or witch which does semantics. the curse is only in terms of literal meaning. And Pinocchio says there are people who would dispute that perspective. But if you say it, if you say  the cilantro taste great, then I then points to you. why do we say multiple things? Because usually because these multiple things have some relation to each other and they help us complete some communicative goal. if you say something , I am angry at her. There's a relationship between these 2 sentences. If you say I am angry at her. And if you do both of these things. also structured kinds of data. there are a lot of, say, meteorological observation stations. And  that's what we're gonna talk about first.st ,  classification. is this email, spam or not spam. It's  one of the poor parts of our modern existence. But that's a that's that's an Nlp problem, email, spam classification or another one is sequence models, which is where you're not just making one single decision , is this one email is this email, spam or non spam, which is one decision. But  to make a sequence of decisions  about every word that you have in your document, , and there are many other paradigms, and deep learning is also one of the algorithms that fit within this top high level topic of machine learning. How does that correspond or map to meaning, that's pretty interesting. then, ,  the high level, then structure of the course will be that there will be some correspondence between the Nlp topic with the linguistic layer, with some of the techniques. we'll have semantics and reference resolution, which is at the meeting level. And that's a controversial topic I might give you one view of it. And and why is that?"

    "Topic 2": [
        "I don't know if it's because they want to  you're saying in the last week 10 response for exactly , is it? Hopefully, we're all in the  place. and this is David Adelani, we're going to introduce ourselves. I'll hide them for . But 1st I thought we thought we would introduce ourselves. and that includes natural language, generation, automatic summarization. you can check the new chapters that have been added any questions  far. you need to work on a language data. you are supposed to come up with a new idea it could be. We are going to announce the due date. if you are late to submit your assignment, you have a grace period of 24 h, which  is very generous. also, in terms of the language policy. it's not  to use this as a primary means to complete your task. we'll also be using the ad platform because he has some advantages. I will release your grades in my courses. Because, , if you're not doing , don't come in and spread it to everyone else ? If you attended the Acl Conference, or you have read about what happened there. And they have impressive performance. that many labs just focus on this also, we have code generation that is not very prominent in social engineering, essay. and our older models, or which I will call inferior models. And sometimes it's even used in setting disputes. I don't think it's the best way to set a dispute. ,  how do language model works? whether a storybook and you can train a language model to just predict what is the  work. given, a context predicts the  one. Another definition could be, what is the probability of the entire text, and also be referred to as the language model? you have a probability distribution that . It's not as simple as just. Training language model on storybook. you could take the entire text in the on the web. This is not about large language models. But this is not a focus of the cost languages everywhere. and I want to also emphasize that language is not all only working on English language. The word language can be translated or can be expressed in different languages in the world. But we also have  many languages in the world. dominates most of the data on the web. I would encourage you to also have projects that extends more. That is more than one language that works on more than one language. But we can also have other  language. Of course, language is primarily vocal, but some are not vocal,  the sign languages. You are producing some form of data. We want to say, this course, is focus on natural language, but we also have other forms of languages  programming languages. That's a simple definition of computational linguistics. the goal of Cl is language technology applications and also scientifically understanding how language works. It could be as how people develop a language it could even be! We often gather data which we call language resources. although they are used inter interchangeably. in terms of natural language, understanding. the original input might be images. But the output will always be text. And the output is text. You have a translation of I  natural language processing in German. Which is, I hope I still remember my German very . 1st language accusation you want to wear cum skip. we are trying to understand what is the innate knowledge. And also there is a way you can detect this by having a structure for each sentence. But, as David pointed out earlier, this is different from the perception, at least by traditionally in linguistics, that the spoken form is the primary form of language. However, Texas is just  convenient. It's it's really simple to have come up with a scheme to store text, and then we can grab all of it from online, and we don't have to do any  messy signal processing to convert acoustic or speech signals into  a into a symbolic form. And  we're primarily going to be working with text. However, you do lose some information by working with text rather than working with speech data. but it means that you might. There might be more diversity, and  to account for that, and people also speak with different accents. But it's by no means a solved problem. even though large language models work by just doing  word prediction. you might still be interested in analyzing these large language models in terms of, ,  you train this model. How do you characterize which aspects of language it seems to be handling  in terms of its behavior, and  which aspects in which it's not handling  . the 1st division here is phonetics. And  there's issues to do with articulation and transmission and perception that you might be interested in and . P. There's a puff of air, there's  a long I sound e, and then there is this something called an African, which is . You build up some pressure in your oral cavity, and then you release it with a puff of air or aspiration. There's this puff of air, the pea and speech is unaspirated. There's no puff of air after that. then we can say that the P. And teach and speech are the same phoneme. In a very subtle way. And then, if you added this, then it changes the changes. And how they affect the meanings of words. English morphology is  relatively simple compared to many other languages. and how you put words together to form sentences, and how those sentences end up being end up, being interpreted as being a string of that language  grammatical or not a string of that language  ungrammatical. It's not a string in the language and grammatical means is . if you I just ran my 1st Marathon in 6 years. And then the 1st person says, No, no,  I don't run them very often. Then, , we have semantics, which is the study of the meaning of language. Typically, they're called multiple senses. I claim that there are at least 2 interpretations of the sentence. and somebody figure out, give me  one of the interpretations. And , it's caused by different senses or interpretations of this article of a . don't dismiss short common words, because those are sometimes the hardest to model in terms of their meanings. And then , another area which I  to study a lot in my lab is pragmatics is the study of meaning of language in context, and in particular, there's often a difference between the literal meaning which has been put in the semantics bucket versus the meaning in context, which is often put in the Pragmatics context. we come to another web comic. If you just phrase every sentence  broadly that they can't be false. Would you  any dessert would be delicious? This one is  something that you one might say , the dessert would be delicious. that illustrates that there's a difference between the literal meaning and the meaning in context and intended meaning in context. This one is called Dixis, which is that the interpretation of expressions can depend on extra linguistic context. In fact, it's quite likely that Hgbt and large language models don't understand these distinctions. And, in fact, there's a whole branch of comedy  absurdist comedy, is based on putting things that are unrelated  to each other for a comedic effect. And and  then that means that we're gonna talk about the technological perspective. But also the  it's linguistic or scientific perspective of all of these phenomena. Very , this is how you can get very high levels of performance and potentially useful or harmful technology that results from this. there might be formal structures that you can posit for this and you can use some  logic. in the middle of the course, we'll talk about using logic to represent the meaning of sentences. Those are continuous valued numbers. And  if we can incorporate that, because the last few lectures of the year they change every year, and we're able to tailor it. then, in terms of the learning outcomes and course objectives, then the goal of Comp. 5, 50 is to help you understand the broad topics and applications and common terminology of the field is to help prepare you for either research or employment, including internships in computational linguistics or Nlp. and at the end, hopefully, you can answer questions , is it easier or hard to do something? this is a really important skill to have, especially because anything related to AI these days is  prominently in the news, and everyone's talking about it  my parents know what Chat Gp is  they asked me about it. And then, some people are , Oh, it's AI gonna take over the world. , any last questions comments."

        "Jackie Cheung, Professor: It's the same. there's a way to keep them, but not show them on screen. we're going to talk all about what this course is about the topics and  forth. if you want to see Jackie. you should come on Monday from 2 to 3 30 pm. And then we have a group project which could be a group of up to 3. ,  the textbook will be using. if you work on all the images except as multimodal. , but it should be at least a project that could extend an existing model to solve a particular task and work on a relevant topic of interest. We're in Quebec,   you could use English or French to write your essay are susceptible. Or  you're  or make your essay better. But please do acknowledge it if you use this technology. , administrative things are over. in general, we're we do not encourage online attendance. even for big profs and  established researchers, thirsty arguments on what is this? But we try to make a distinction here. We want to clarify what this lecture is not about. 2020, when the charge pity come out who remembers 22? For you to predict the  word you have to decide using different algorithms to say, what  word to predict? or should I predict accidents? And nowadays we even use a bigger, bigger purpose for that. , what this course is not about. , what this course is about other. What this cost is not about the latest techniques in large longer. This is not the course. Covering different applications and has a lot of importance both for a daily task and in different industries. and then in the Americans and European languages which. many of these languages are underrepresented,  we can only say only 7% of the languages are can be categorized at institutional that are used for many, many different things, including education and business, and  on. It can be referred to as a form of communication. arbitrary part pairing diff between form and meaning. try to understand the language  it could be how language works in general. I don't be focuses on more practical technologies. You want to know, really understand how language works? They can be considered as primarily nlu task. one example of understand is call a taxi to take me to the airport in 30 min in any of your task. and another one is, what is the weather forecast for tomorrow? This is talking about another domain, but has another index, but generation is different. And and we've also seen some of the goals of the field. And and it's it's  it's discrete. And that's also how the field is, it's the vast majority of the work is on textual data. it's an idealization of the spoken language. how many people have had a misunderstanding because, somebody you were texting with didn't understand. And in fact, that's there are theories that  this  loss is why emojis and  Smileys and things became be became popular, became used  in terms of informal a textual communication, and that we're losing something which is  important for communication, and  we add it back in  in nlp, then, a lot of the older work has been on clean, formal standard English especially English, because a lot of the researchers back then were from, say, the Us. But that's very limited, and the things have changed quite a bit in the past few years, and that  we work on many other languages as  as David also does. No, there's still a lot of work to be done. ,   I'm going to talk about how linguists, at least, have traditionally divided up language, the phenomenon of language, into these different subdomains. this is really important and useful to know. Suppose we have the word peach. You can have a relatively low, level transcription of the speech sounds that make up the word peach. And  vowels are more continuous. But it's a different area of study that studies the rules regarding how sounds are patterned in a language and how they're organized with each other. we come to the interactive part of this lecture. here we have 3 related, similarly sounding words, peach and speech and beach. Whereas Beach is different because it's a b sound. , , all 3 of these sounds are pronounced differently. And there's a phonological rule that tells that in, if you speak a. a native version of English, then there's a phonological rule that changes the way that the P sounds in different environments. specifically, the pea and peach is supposed to be aspirated. and the B and beach is just a different sound, and there your vocal cords will vibrate. ,  then, you can  study this, there's a rule here. And this is , this is a rule in English. If you speak French, if you're a native French speaker, your B's and your P's are  different from the B's and P's in English. You can check that at home and ask your friends or something, whereas, and also with the peas in French, the puff. we have morphology, which is about the study of word formation and meaning. And then this, and then establishment Aryanism. Then you have a establishment which is, , turns it into some noun related to something that's being established. And then you add an anti. linguistic trivia point is that English  has a very simple, relatively simple system of word formation. For , then is syntax. syntax is the study of the structure of language. Another interesting thing is that these phenomena and language there are aspects of them that cause. ,  here is a comic. The other person says, 6 years. And then the second one says, , that's fairly obvious. if you draw some tree structure, the ambiguity comes from the fact that this prepositional phrase, in 6 years it might modify different things. It might modify that the marathon is the 1st one in 6 years,  it attaches to the noun, which is the incorrect interpretation, or that you, you ran it in 6 years  that it was. Here we have 2 senses of the word bank. It can either be the bank of a river or the bank, as in the financial institution. This is this one is less obvious. this one is Pinocchio was cursed  that his nose would grow whenever he lied. ,  it's a it's a semantic curse. ,  this curse is pretty easily managed. one prominent example is pronouns. This is pretty obvious, ? and that's also an area of study. it's sometimes you can violate some of these common properties in order to make some point, but by default we assume that there should be some logical structure within our discourse. say, how you collect the data, how you work with the data itself. And  what we do in Nlp is, we do a lot of work on problem specification, on thinking about machine learning algorithms, on eliciting annotations from humans, especially when we have a particular  representation that we want to parse it to, . a lot of data is in some non human readable form. And they collect a bunch of data there. And that's also useful data. And we might want to interface with that data or work with that data . and traditionally, they have been hand engineered systems. how do you formally encode information in a way that's useful or interpretable ? And and we can talk about pros and cons at that point as , or with, say, neural networks. A a lot of the activations within,  a neural network model. Then the  topic will be something  language modeling and part of speech tagging. And you're closer to the end of the course. I already talked about this. the  lecture is  Wednesday, because  Monday is Labor Day. hope you have a good week."

        "Oh, , great Hi,   natural language processing. I am an associate professor in the School of computer science and I'm also affiliated with Mila. And then some terms that you may or may not know  computational semantics and computational pragmatics as  as applications. I work on topics around multilingual Nlp machine translation, representation Lane. I'll take few slides before adding over to Jackie. I'm  if I didn't pronounce it. for the evaluation we have 2 programming assignments, which will be 20%. We're going to have  4 reading assignments, 5% each and then at the in the middle of the semester, we are going to have a midterm which will be 25% of the average. But it's more consistent with Juraski test book on speech and language processing, and it's publicly available. on the assignments we have  2 programming assignments. which will be very similar to some of the things you have been taught in class. or a little bit of advanced materials that we are not able to cover. for the midterm this will cover 25%. this gives us the opportunity to really test what you have been taught in class. This is an Nlp class. We need  the and review relevant papers, report on the experiment and must be done in a team of 3.   there will be a template. If it's more than 24 h. . I know you have the question, can I use Chat Gpt, or any other language model for the exercise? but it's not that you copy the entire code for your project from chat to pick. A complete paragraph using Chan Gpt. Also don't use it to generate your entire report. we are going to be using different platforms. And then we'll be releasing most of the details on these platforms. The meet I'm also will be there. I'll I'll just take few slides before handing it over to Jackie. we want to make a distinction between computational linguistics and natural language processing. People still do not agree on what is competition, linguist linguistics? My colleague here has more background in computational linguistics than me. I'm more from the Nlp side. when I was doing my Phd question, answering is a very, very difficult task. Also, back in the days was a very big topic and very difficult task. I'll find the task of summarization. I've gotten our lstn very difficult. And also we have commercial uses use cases from customer service, personal assistant and healthcare, and also for entertainment. Then you can tell me if this prediction is  or wrong, artificial number processing remains 10 years away. just as it has for the last few decades. It's as simple as sentence complexion. if I say, Mary had a little lamp. And then you can rank the prediction and say, , which world is more likely to be predicted? Is it a law or accident? And you can have more than 5 different words. , , all the text of Wikipedia, English, Wikipedia, and training language model. How did we get to land number models? What was the progress of the field of Nlp. How did we get to land? Longer models dominating the end of your research. what was the progress of the field of Nlp. How do we evaluate and analyze Nlp systems? The properties are much no longer reflected in an open search. In my view, that covers some of this deep learning machine learning as a primary focus. Of course we all use machine learning in some ways or the other. for your projects, you will  also use machine learning. One of my research area is multilingual nlp, we, because we have  many languages in the world. Nlp should be beyond English. whether voice or text, or  on. which is what you use to code vocalization by your favorite animal,  a dog or cat or written English. ,  computational linguistics to distinguish between Cl and Nlp. Modeling natural language with computational models and techniques. That  work for both Nlp and Nl. the methodology and techniques, of course, is very standard, which might also be similar to Nlp. and sometimes we also have rule based methods. Nlp, on the other hand. Cl, can we can refer you to as more science or Nlp is more engineering because you just want to make things work for a large number of people or for practical use cases. But in generation you really want to produce text but also to be traditionally referred to as semantic formalism to text. But more recently, it's more about you're giving a tax, and you want to generate something it doesn't have to be your provided input and text. It could be current or can be an intent it could be transport to the airport can be an intent it would be. Wake me up  alarm can be an intent wake up time, and  on. Where you have to produce a text, it could be in the same language, or it could be in another language , Here you are. Besides new language technologies, there are other reasons to study Co and Nlp as . And  all of , chomsky. And this is an interesting research which you can study even from a baby acquiring a new language. And here, in incl you want to have a formal mathematical model to account for this. This is one example the rat escaped, and then you have the rats. if you have a structure for a sentence, you can know what is broken in the sentence. because every language has a structure some languages the verb has to be in the middle, some languages the verb is in the front. And the question is, can they be efficiently learned from data or efficiently recovered from a sentence? I'll talk a little bit more about what we're analyzing. And then a little bit after that, we're going to talk about the different ways in which you can break down the phenomenon of language and potentially look at these phenomena separately, or to look at the interactions between these phenomena. ,  in this course, we're primarily going to be focusing on text. , one thing you might lose is  tone of voice, and it might be more difficult to convey,  your attitude. much , , speech has disfluencies. ,  broken lines of thought and trains of thought, and  forth, and that you resume   then there are different techniques to try to deal with, that there are also non standard language, which is extremely interesting. Just try to do use, do ASR in  a noisy environment where there are multiple streams of speech, and you'll quickly realize that. And  then we can turn to these divisions from linguistics. some linguists really believe that these divisions are cognitively, somehow real in our minds, in our model of language. , for the p sound that involves closing of your lips. This might not work   about that, and if you say beach there should be no puff of air, but your vocal cords should vibrate a little bit earlier. But they're  phonetically distinct from each other. This is one of the ways you can tell. The little puff I talked about tends to be much weaker or non-existent compared to a native English speaker. traditionally, then, people have drawn tree structures to represent relations between different parts of a sentence and then put those together. you can analyze this syntactically. It's  some structural analysis of sentences. And there are sub areas of semantics as ,  a big one that we've done, we do a lot of work, or at least we used to do a lot of work on and still do in computational linguistics is something called lexical semantics, which is the study of word meaning. a very popular task, at least last decade in Nlp has been something called word sense, disambiguation. you see all of these words. Pinocchio, did you bully that boy at school? or Pinocchio, did you egg my door? This one is more innocuous, sir. And  and this one is  pretty common, ? in fact, you could say something , Oh, if someone asks you, would you  any dessert? You can say, Oh, dessert would be delicious, but not today for me. There are other issues in pragmatics which are quite interesting. If I say  cilantro tastes great, then the I there is pointing to me as the speaker. But if you have to come up with formal analyses of these things. the entity referred to, the antecedent depends on who is saying the sentence. and , then that means that quite naturally, most things, most utterances, and most sentences that you say one after the other, or you put in text one after the other, there'll be some logical relation between them. And  that should be reflected by the text that she generates as , or that attribute generates, or in terms of how they interpret it. There's no relation between them, and  it doesn't make any sense, and this is not coherent. And you can analyze that as . , in this course, we're going to cover many of these different areas,  2 different levels of depth. But we're going to try our best to cover some of the basic distinctions and also computational models and algorithms related to all of these areas. in modern Nlp, there's often we often think about modern Nlp as some combination of some pre specified knowledge, and also machine learning from data. Not all Nlp methods necessarily have to be machine learning based or machine learning methods, but still some of the ways in which we investigate these issues might include thinking about. And what form and representation the data should have as  as the algorithms and methods and models that you construct and train on top of this data. and also through, say, linguistic knowledge, through linguistic analyses of languages, and we combine that with learning from data, from websites, news articles, whatever's on the Internet. And that's also part of Nlp, is that interfacing? some of the major paradigms that have been pursued in Nlp, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive include rule based systems. For knowledge about language,  in French, translates to happy,  some of the time most of the time machine learning , giving examples and letting some statistical method figure out the associations between those examples. , , we'll start with text classification where we mostly are concerned at the granularity of individual words. And we're going to look at machine learning techniques for it within the classification paradigm. And then the linguistic layer is also words, but potentially also syntactic structures. And the machine learning techniques involved would be models that are designed specifically to handle sequence data. And then we might look at syntactic parsing. And then where the linguistic layer is the syntactic structure, and then the techniques involved would involve structure, prediction algorithms and also various dynamic programming algorithms that can help us more efficiently explore all possible parses of the sentence. And then and then we're going to look at techniques for representation of meaning,  logic and also machine learning techniques  semi-supervised learning and neural models. Then we'll talk about machine translation, summarization and potentially other applications potentially other issues with evaluation and ethics of Nlp. we're going to learn some basic linguistics along the way, we're going to learn some basic algorithms. And hopefully, you'll be able to read an Nlp paper and understand the challenges that are in computational linguistics and analy."

I'm sure you all know the university rules on this. or you write an essay. and there's a procedure on how to go about this if you are caught. we're using zoom today as  a backup lecture recording, although it's supposed to be automatically done. There will be lecture recordings. and if you're sick, then you can ask us for the zoom link. But  otherwise the, we won't make the zoom link just publicly available. let's go into the lecture. you can also see some balance in the lecture. We all know about Llms Chat gpt, and  on. What did he say that this new technology, the thing that was going to change everything was starting to  change everything. you have 2 good choices. That would be a good completion but these days it's more, of course. This is not a cost about it. We started from somewhere, ? What are some of the common tasks and paradigms involving natural language, including very basic classification tasks and linear models will be covered in this course. What are the metrics that are used. including very basic metrics  accuracy. The largest proportion of the languages in the world are in Asia, followed by Africa, and then the Pacific. or that scales to other languages. And in language, one thing that is important is how it is highly expressive and productive. But of course, we would be focusing on the natural language, not program languages. The domains of natural language can be acoustic signal for names, words, signal syntax, semantics. it involves natural language, understanding, or comprehension or natural language generation, . There's a big distinction about whether you're working on Nlu task or Nlg. But nowadays we tend to be the model. Task and in speech processing they also have this distinction for Nlu and Nlg task. But there's a slight difference. And Esr, the input is voice or audio. most work in Nlp is an Nlu for even very basic tasks,  tagging battle speed, tagging name, density, recognition. For think about a dialogue system. You want to know what is the intent of the user. If I ask you, what is the intent of the user here, call a taxi to take me to the airport in 30 min. and then you can have different categorization of the intent of user. And also we do have some complexity analysis. I'll continue to do that rather than to  work. by , then, you have at least some basic sense of what the terms computational linguistics and natural language processing mean. And Canada, Uk, and  forth. And also  we work on a more diverse set of text, not just formal text, but also these informal texts that I just talked about  text messages and online communications. working with speech is also a research area, very important. and some of the tasks there in speech processing include automatic speech, recognition, and text to speech generation among others. It's not the only thing. Here we are,  more neutral. we have phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pramatics, discourse. phonetics is the sub area of linguistics that studies speech sounds the speech sounds that make up language, or, in the case of sign languages, is  the way which she articulates with parts of her body to produce sign language outputs. , your lips have to come together. you can have these very detailed studies of speech, sounds. Phonology is something that's often confused with phonetics. what I'd  you to do is to say peach and speech, but put , put your hand in front of your mouth  you can feel the puff of air. , you say, Peach, you can feel it. If you say speech, you should not be able to feel it again. If you're not a native speaker of English. whenever P appears after an S. Its pronunciation changes in English. You start by rating your vocal cords a tiny little bit earlier than in the be than for the B's in English. even sounds that appear to be the same sounds across languages there, there might be slight phonetic differences between them. then, we had phonetics and phonology. here's a really long word in English anti disestablishmentarianism, and you can break that down into these different chunks which we can call morphemes. You can even analyze it, starting from the stem, and you keep adding prefixes and suffixes, and each time you change some property of the word,  you have established, which is a verb. Then this establishmentarian, , is somebody who is pro establishment, . and then you have Establishmentarianism, which is the philosophy or belief related to us, being establishmentarian. This  that you're,  I don't even know anymore. we still have an English bias, but in other languages, ,  Finnish or Czech or Swahili, many other languages have very complex morphologies, where one word has many, many parts, a lot of them involve conjugations to express meanings that in English we would use a separate word or an adverb. in English, we have strict rules about the orderings of words, and how you're allowed to put them together to form a sentence. if you say IA woman saw a park Indie, that is not an English sentence, that's not a grammatical sentence of English. You have to arrange them in a particular way,  I saw a woman in the park. And if you're able to put them together according to some grammar, then it's a valid sentence. ,  , where does the ambiguity here come from? And  what does that mean? it can mean various different things. how do you figure out which sense of the word is the intended sense in that particular context. I wonder if you can figure this puzzle out. Ross wants to marry a Swedish woman. Yes, the specific woman that wants Ross wants to marry is Swedish and Ross wants to marry any Swedish woman. here one interpretation, which is hopefully the more common one is that there's a specific woman that Ross wants to marry who happens to be a Swedish woman. And then the other interpretation is that Ross really has a thing for Swedish women and really wants to marry one of them. there's a there's a difference, ? It's not a pragmatic curse. If you're accusing me of such a deed, I have nothing more to say. that in terms of the literal meaning none of these statements  evaluate to false. But it's clear that there is a interpretation that any reasonable speaker of the language would give. I would claim, although you can dispute me. this discourse is the study of the structure of larger spans of language beyond individual clauses or sentences. She lost my cell phone. This is coherent because it's clear that there are. The rabbit jumped and ate 2 carrots. Or if you have any topics you would  to explore that are more in that area that may be more applied or advanced. If you're if you send us suggestions or recommendations. You can feel free to agree or disagree, but at least by the end of the course you'll be able, you should be able to better argue that for your point of view,  yes,  AI will take over the world because or no, it's overhyped ? ,  if not, then, , we'll end up early today."

Jackie Cheung, Professor: the captions button disappeared. please use that because this link no longer works. And we're going to look at how we got to the current state of generative AI from this line of work. And then we'll look at some simple, basic methods from the past for document summarization. Every span of whatever granularity you're interested in into a representation. If this has low average distance to all of the other points in the source, then that's located. It turns out that the beginning is the picking that the opening sentences is the best predictor of important information. The heuristic here is that a term is important or indicative of a document, if it appears many times within that document, but is relatively rare overall. The topic signature method works extremely . And again, this is based on just a very simple notion. Then it would score highly. You can ask students and to use a summary you either. or you might be interested in testing whether summaries improve the speed of doing something else. and then they either they had one condition where the people had to just look at the documents themselves alone, or they can have access to both the document and a summary of the document.

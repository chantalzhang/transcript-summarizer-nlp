Hmms and crf were some of the most important models that dominated the field for more than 5 years. And today we're going to see how we can go from Hmms to crf. And some of these methods can still be useful in practice. the gradient is 0. K. , this is very easy to estimate, but this will. take more time. and then we have the exponential of this. This call is the explanation. here we have y music in the slides. But let me double check my notes, but from the very 1st step the sum over, I we just forgot to write it to the . it's just the last time.

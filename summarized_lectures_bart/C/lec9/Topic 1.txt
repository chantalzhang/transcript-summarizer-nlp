Today, we'll consider sequence modeling with features with a focus on linear chain conditional random fields conditional rental fields. And then we also have observed variables . For the case of Patos Beach, the States will be the pos tax. And if you have been able to compute all the statistics needed. And in that case a discriminative model is more realistic. activities. , because F of K would be one, ? Is that a 1 or 0? each of the 3 can do. There's no analytical emery solution. why aren't we normalizing here? Given the sense you minimize but of course there are other metals the conjugate gradient, or what is called the Lbfgs. You minimize the negative log, likely. And then you do this for a while. And here we can compute what is the gradient of the log likelihood based on the Crm formulation.

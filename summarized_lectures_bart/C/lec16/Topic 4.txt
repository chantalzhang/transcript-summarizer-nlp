We're going to expand our grammar a little bit to account for several other phenomena. We're gonna talk about more kinds of verbs, and then we're also going to talk about quantifiers. We've done intransitive verbs and transitive verbs. The last step to get to the sentence level is the same. Bertrand Russell said there exists an X such that p of x, and . It means that there's a there exists a uniqueX such that . How did we come up with this rule? And then we need to write it what he said. First, st it has to exist, a unique thing. And if it's unique, that means everything else that has that predicate must be that thing. 1st reading. We want an underspecified representation that is compatible with both readings. After you've read the whole syllabus, and then you can go back to retrieve and derive the corrects disambiguated meaning representation. The under specified representation for every student took a course.

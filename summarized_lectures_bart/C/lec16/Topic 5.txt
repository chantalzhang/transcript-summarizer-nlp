Lambdas are there to help you figure out or to express that you're still missing information. And then, when you do more syntactic composition, then you combine more pieces of meaning representation together. And all of these steps is applications of Lambdas. But again, conceptually, it's exactly the same. Pnq, the A is the existential. , let me say that this is what we're aiming for. My question is, what is the semantic attachment for that. And we figure this out assuming that there's some other rule that combines nouns with adjectives. Can other people see the issue?

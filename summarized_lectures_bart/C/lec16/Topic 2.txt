Jackie Cheung, Professor: Each word at the leaf of the tree is associated with some fragment of meaning representation in the logic that we care about. And then and then this rules E part. that's why we do this complex thing of of this is called reification. But the concept is the same. semantically, it should not matter, for if all the adjectives are the majority class of these are called subsective adjectives. But it's that they're faking with respect to the specific property of studenthood studentness. And for that reason, semantically, you cannot take this approach of modeling as a conjunction of multiple predicates. And if you, if you dutifully work through all of the syntactic compositions with the semantic attachments. that's a problem with our current approach.

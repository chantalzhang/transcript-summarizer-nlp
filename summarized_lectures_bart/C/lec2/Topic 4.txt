If we were to take the previous example and talk about predicting positive versus negative sentiment, then that counts as the task of sentiment analysis. Formulate the NLP problem as a machine learning problem that's a very common paradigm. In machine learning, we have document classifier, document label. We specify what the possible YS mean and then we're going to train a classifier on top of the document. You have your input document and then feature extraction means converting. And then we have to also talk about the inputs. The main key behind both limitization and stemming is to rewrite. in these examples, here, , relational and relate, if you have the word relate, it might also end up being relate. then you're not distinguishing between relate and relational, . Amount of data that you have. Words verbs and nouns and adjectives and even punctuation in text. that you've in which you formulate it, then it should be, is it just positive versus negative or is it positive, neutral, negative, or very positive, very positive. here, if I formulated a sentiment analysis, what we're solving is a sentimentAnalysis problem of , what is that particular piece of text described? this is something that you can think of as a validity problem.

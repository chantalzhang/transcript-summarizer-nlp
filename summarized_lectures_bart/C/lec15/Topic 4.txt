, the midterm is, , Wednesday, if I remember . It's not about the meaning of 2 words in a sentence. One important concept from the second half of last class is this idea of a term context matrix. You're using the distribution of words in order to infer something about the meanings of those words. And it's still based on these fundamental ideas. The tradition that we're going to discuss today and class is to use logic to model sentence meaning. And that means at some point. using 1st order logic using those predicates and functions then an interpretation of it or a model of it is possible. In rolex students, we have 3 predicates, and we have grade of X is equal to a why can't we just have 8 here. But just a is a constant, it gives you an element in your domain of discourse. Yet we can't tell if it's true or false yet. wouldn't that contradict the 1st statement that students who do both get an a . It's not defined by the set of logical symbols that I put earlier, logical connectives that had earlier. You just have to define what it means. how do we interpret this logic within a particular context? why associated population, it always applies another qualified into the inside. that's part of designing this augmented grammar. If you have a different rule that works in a different way, you have to follow that. That's what we're trying to do here.

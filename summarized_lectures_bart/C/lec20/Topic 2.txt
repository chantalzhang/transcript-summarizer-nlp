language typically occurs in bigger chunks than individual sentences. relationships between sentences and also phenomena that cut across sentences that we want to think about. One of the ways in which we can computationally estimate whether a passage is coherent or not is to check if there are devices that link. Hobbes algorithm from the seventies is a heuristic algorithm that puts together all of these cues and comes up with a method for co-reference resolution based on that. In English the subject comes before the object, and then left to works for English. Later on we'll look at machine learning algorithms that might be able to do a better job. outputs, and forth. It gives you a score, for whether it's a mention or not, and you can do that, do supervised learning on this. , what they do is they implement the proposal that we had from the class earlier, which is, you pass it a passage and then extracts a bunch of mentions, and it also extracts what these mentions point to previously in the context.

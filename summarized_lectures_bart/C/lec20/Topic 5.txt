Hobbes algorithm searches the current sentence where you find the pronoun to left, starting at the pronoun. It then tries to find an antecedent that matches in terms of number and gender using the syntax tree.

It would not ever propose a beautiful cupcake or the patisserie window on their own. It encounters the 1st noun phrase that it does that matches a number and gender. And then, a huge noun phrase.

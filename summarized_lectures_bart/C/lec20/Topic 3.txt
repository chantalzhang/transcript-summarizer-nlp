If you have coherent passages, will you always find cohesive devices between them? You'll find cohesive links between. these are called anaphoric devices. But it's hard to model this and do this for impractical settings, because, . one thing that you could do that is still useful is Co-reference. We learn with hearse patterns. you're saying that Hearst patterns might give you patterns that help you figure out co-reference links. that would be more for the whole problem. , yes, would any sequence modeling framework work for this task. But you could it would output a probability there or something being mentioned or not.

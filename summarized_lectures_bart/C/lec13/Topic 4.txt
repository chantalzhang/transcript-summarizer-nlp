, today we're going to start talking about lexical semantics. That's by following a probability distribution. Otherwise, the bit is gonna not make any sense at all. Then the and at the end of the last lecture we discussed probabilistic, context-free grammars. And that's by looking at a tree bank with all of these syntactic trees. words. The 1st was frege in 1892 he was one of the 1st to distinguish between the sense of a term, and its reference. And all of these, a lot of these. You can express these in some logic as . And this is simply an is a relationship. The smaller thing, the thing that denotes fewer things in the world is called the hyponym. and the word that denotes more things is called a hypernym.

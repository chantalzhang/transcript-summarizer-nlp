where you try to redistribute the some probabilities to unknown tokens. and you have not estimated that probability. to talkings all and grams that you don't know their probability when they count is 0. You can make it depend on just the last token or the last previous 2 tokens. Given the context C, and that will be probability of N. WTWT. And then you can compute the infinite probability. Terms of more that complexity trade off. You have to think carefully about this. WTWT, thank you for joining today's class. We hope to see you again next week.

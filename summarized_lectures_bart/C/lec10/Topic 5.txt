Lstms has a way to fix that. You don't need every cell to always have an output. This is very similar to , , if you forward a talk yes, there's a question. Yes, someone is trying to type something many to one you but you need for the documents. For part of speed tagging, but which menu to menu would you use for longer? Because you feel this is not important. Lstm scores with those of the transition probabilities. You do a forward pass from every state, every cell to the other in the Lstm. And after that you can do back propagation from the element, from the Crf layer back to all the LStm layers. We have a very good understanding of this.

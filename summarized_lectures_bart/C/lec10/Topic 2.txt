Lectures 10 and 11 will be on artificial neural networks and recurrent neural networks. The reading assignments will be posted on Friday, October 11th. If you have questions on the reading assignments, please post on it and I will try to answer. Today's lecture will be from Professor Jackie Sean. Lstm is a type of neural network that can be used for machine translation. Lstm can be combined with Crm to create a powerful model. It can also be used to capture different context of information. It's very important for tax part of speed, tagging name extra recognition, chunking.

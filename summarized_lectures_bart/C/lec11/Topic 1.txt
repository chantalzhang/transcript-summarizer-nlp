, we're talking about universities that you're you're pumped and that you are open. is it doing the 11th , when I checked and my courses was the top. We're going to look at some particular characteristics or properties of English syntax themselves. And then we're also gonna look at a formal system for describing structure called context-free grammars. Natural language can be thought of as sets of a set of string. We're going to use a more powerful class of formal grammars. These are in particular context, free grammar. These become 3 separate symbols in our system. And we can do that. Grammars are just a different view of the hierarchical structure of language. It shares this basic property and assumption that it that it's hierarchical. A noun can be 1st or second or 3rd person. And that's really cool because it's a computational model.

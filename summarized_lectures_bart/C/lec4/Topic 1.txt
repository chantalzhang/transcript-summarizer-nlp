Programming assignment one will be released. Will we be building our own model? It could be naive base, it could be logistic regression. neural network, perceptron, SVM, anything. We are operating on discrete values. It's either a cat or a dog. It does not mean you have a definition of your vocabulary. there's no notion of similarity. And that's why nowadays we focus more on sentence representation. And if the language model is able to fill in the gap properly, that means it has learned a very good representation of many words in the large text composure provided. And this concept is very related to transfer learning, which I will cover in 2 minutes.

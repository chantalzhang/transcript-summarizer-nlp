Professor Lane is an associate professor in the School of computer science. He works on topics around multilingual Nlp machine translation. Lane: Nlp should be beyond English whether voice or text, or on. which is what you use to code vocalization by your favorite animal. In Nlp, we look at the different ways in which you can break down the phenomenon of language and potentially look at these phenomena separately. In this course, we're primarily going to be focusing on text. And we're going to try our best to cover some of the basic distinctions and also computational models. We'll start with text classification where we mostly are concerned at the granularity of individual words. And then and then we're going to look at techniques for representation of meaning, logic and also machine learning techniques semi-supervised learning and neural models. Then we'll talk about machine translation, summarization and potentially other applications.

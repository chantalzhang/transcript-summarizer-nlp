We are going to continue our discussion about syntax. We talked about these things called constituents, which are groups of words that acts together. And we also talked about tests for constituency. And the other thing we talked about is we talk about context-free grammars. you see in the sentence you're trying to. the possible rewrite rules and you try to find a way to rewrite the non terminal symbols to get finer and finer grained until you get to rules that let you generate the actual words. using the rules. rules by matching the words 1st to non-terminals and then the non- Terminals to bigger non-Terminals. rewrites to something else, you want to remove that intermediate level that you have AV rights to the thing directly. These are called unary rules, because it involves exactly one hand side. And it has some rules that are unary. st , can you guys help me? The Np to N, yes. One important thing to note is that you keep the original rules, too. you have 2 copies of the rules of generating. You can do one diagonal at a time, do the diagonal, and then to do the things to the diagonals and forth. You can do any combination of them that you that you would. And then every time you see a starting symbol, you can just use the back pointers to trace through all of the possible paths. If you tilt your head 45Â° this way you can even see directly in the parts in the chart. say that each non terminal symbol that rewrites to something is to say that. Each non-terminal symbol that. rewrited to something else that forms are probability distribution. This is called a tree bank. A tree bank is a collection of trees in a bank, with , a with sentences.
